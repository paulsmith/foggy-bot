    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly, blustery evening with temperatures hovering in the mid-20s. The air is crisp and carries a piercing wind that can make it feel even colder, while the cloudy sky contributes to a dim atmosphere over the beach, where the waves roll gently against the shore. Tonight's forecast suggests a slight change, with partial clearing and a low only slightly below freezing, accompanied by a light west wind, making for a pleasant, if cool, evening walk for the hearty.\n\nLooking ahead to Thursday, there\u2019s a forecasted chance of snow in the afternoon, with temperatures expected to rise to the mid-30s. Gusts from the southeast could stir up the waves a bit, leading to potentially lively conditions on Lake Michigan. Those venturing out should prepare for chilly, possibly wet weather as light snow could begin accumulating. Given the season, these temperatures are within the typical range for December in this region, marking a wintry landscape balanced with the promise of flurries. Residents are advised to bundle up, donning warm layers, hats, and gloves to stay cozy during outdoor activities, perhaps a wintry stroll along the lakeshore to enjoy the holiday season ambiance.",
