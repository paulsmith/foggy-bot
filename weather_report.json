    "weather_report": "The current weather in Evanston, Illinois is quite chilly, with temperatures hovering in the mid-20s and a strong, blustery wind adding a biting chill to the air. Clouds blanket the sky, casting a dull light over the landscape, creating a somewhat gloomy atmosphere perfect for sipping warm beverages indoors. As the afternoon progresses, the temperature is expected to dip slightly, with an increased chance of snow after 5 PM, promising a few inches of accumulation overnight. The wind will shift to a gentler breeze, but gusts will still deliver a chilly sting, especially near the lake where conditions can feel harsher.\n\nWith some light snowfall on the way, this isn't the best time for outdoor activities. Those venturing out should bundle up warmly\u2014think heavy coats, gloves, and perhaps a scarf to ward off the cold. The waterfront may be a bit tumultuous as well, with moderate to high waves typical for this time of year, making it best to observe from indoors rather than braving the elements on the shore. As Valentine's Day unfolds, it's a fitting occasion for cozy gatherings or cozy meals at home, contemplating the warmth of companionship against the backdrop of a wintry day.",
