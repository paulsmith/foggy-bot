    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the morning unfolds beneath a mostly cloudy sky, with a chill in the air hinting at winter's approach. Temperatures hover in the mid 20s, accompanied by a brisk and biting northwesterly wind that adds to the cool sensation. As the day progresses, the forecast suggests partial sunshine and a high near the upper 30s, with temperatures likely dipping back into the low 30s come afternoon. This transition will bring with it a touch of clarity, but the strong gusts may leave one feeling rather brisk. \n\nTonight, a subtle chance of snow showers lingers, primarily between 9 PM and 3 AM, amidst a backdrop of scattered clouds. As for Lake Michigan, expect moderate wave action; the surf could prove entertaining for observers but best avoided by swimmers given the conditions. It\u2019s advisable to bundle up with warm layers, a sturdy coat, and perhaps a scarf to fend off the wind\u2019s chill. Seasonal temperatures are typical for late November in this region, urging indoor pursuits over outdoor explorations. With no major holidays today, this is an opportune moment for cozy indoor gatherings or catching up on reading, allowing one to stay warm while the chilly winds whip outside.",
