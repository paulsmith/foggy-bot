    "weather_report": "This morning in Evanston, conditions are brisk and clear with a temperature hovering in the high 20s, accompanied by a sharp wind that carries a bit of chill. As you step outside, the air feels fresh and invigorating, enhanced by the dry warmth of the sunlight. However, later today, expect a shift as the weather turns partly sunny with a high near 30 degrees, though a gradual decline in temperatures is likely during the afternoon.\n\nTonight brings a slight chance of snow showers before midnight, shrouding the skies in a more overcast trend. The temperature will dip to around 25, but may feel slightly warmer through the night as the winds shift to a gentle northeast breeze. Wave conditions along Lake Michigan are likely to be somewhat choppy due to the breezy conditions, which could make for interesting viewing but may not be ideal for outdoor activities by the water.\n\nGiven these conditions, layering is advisable if heading outdoors, with a warm coat, hat, and gloves recommended to fend off the cool air. Although the day is not particularly warm for February, it's not unusual for this time of year in the Midwest. The day invites a range of activities, from bundled-up walks along the beach to enjoying a warm drink at a local caf\u00e9. Today is not a holiday, but with the forecast hinting at possible snow, it might be a nice opportunity to embrace the beauty of winter.",
