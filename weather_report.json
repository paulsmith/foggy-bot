    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather presents a chilly scene, with temperatures hovering in the low 40s and a gentle wind whispering in from the southeast. The air feels damp and raw, creating a rather gloomy atmosphere typical of a winter day by the lake. Expect the mood to linger throughout today, as areas of drizzle and patches of fog are likely to persist, with a high nearing the mid 40s. The afternoon may dip slightly, complementing the ever-cloudy sky. Wave conditions are moderate, reflecting a steady but somewhat restless Lake Michigan, aligning with the drizzly ambiance.\n\nAs the day wears on into the evening, it\u2019s advisable to bundle up, opting for warm, waterproof attire to fend off the chill and potential drizzle. Despite the rather uninviting weather, it might be a good day for indoor activities\u2014perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 or a local museum to escape the dampness outside. Being the day after Christmas, many may still be reveling in holiday festivities, making it a time to reflect and relax indoors. Overall, while the outdoor conditions are uncomfortable, there's a quiet beauty in winter's chill that can be enjoyed from the warmth of inside.",
