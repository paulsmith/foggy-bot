    "weather_report": "Evanston, Illinois is experiencing quite a wintry evening, with temperatures lingering in the mid-30s, accompanied by light sleet and rain creating a rather dreary atmosphere. The air feels brisk, with a blustery wind adding to the chill as gusts whip around at nearly 46 miles per hour. This stormy weather is expected to persist throughout the night, transitioning from rain to patchy fog as temperatures hover around the high 30s. The forecast predicts an unusually high likelihood of continued precipitation, with rainfall totals potentially reaching up to half an inch, making for a soggy landscape along Lake Michigan.\n\nThe scene outside appears quite uninviting, with the sky cloaked in clouds, limiting visibility and casting a gloomy pall over the beach area. The waves on the lake are likely moderate, influenced by the strong winds, making it an unfavorable time for activities by the water. As for attire, residents and visitors alike are best advised to bundle up in warm, waterproof clothing: think heavy coats, scarves, and sturdy shoes to navigate the slippery terrain. While not ideal for outdoor excursions, cozy indoor activities may be more suitable for this chilly December day. As we approach the holiday season, the mood might still dare to remain festive despite the unpleasantness outside, encouraging folks to find warmth in their homes and communities.",
