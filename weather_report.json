    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a chilly and overcast scene with temperatures lingering in the low 50s, accompanied by a moderately high humidity that gives the air a damp feel. Wind gusts howl off Lake Michigan at impressive speeds, contributing to the decidedly brisk atmosphere. As we look ahead, rain is expected to roll in later this afternoon, turning the skies an even deeper gray, and it appears that the evening will bring a steady downpour. With a 100% chance of precipitation, locals can expect over half an inch of rain, which may lead to muddier conditions along the beach.\n\nIn terms of attire, a warm jacket and waterproof gear are advisable if you plan to be outdoors, especially as temperatures are projected to rise slightly as night approaches. This is typical for mid-November in this region, where cooler temperatures and damp weather often characterize the season. Given the forecast and the current blustery conditions, one might steer clear of outdoor activities, opting instead for cozy indoor pursuits. The beach, while often a lively social scene, is left to the waves crashing against the shore, but it could be a meditative spot to observe nature's fury from a safe distance. With Thanksgiving just around the corner, this weather serves as a reminder of the approaching holiday season, a time when family gatherings often warm the spirit, despite the chill outside.",
