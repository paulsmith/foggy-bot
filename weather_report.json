    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reflect a brisk morning, with temperatures hovering in the low single digits. The air feels distinctly frosty, enhanced by a blustery wind that carries a chill, making it wise to prepare for a formidable wind chill. Today, expect mostly sunny skies, a welcome sight as the sun rises higher, with afternoon temperatures climbing to the low 20s. Although the forecast suggests a pleasant interval of sun, be prepared for wind gusts that could reach up to 25 miles per hour, which will amplify the cool feel of the day.\n\nLater tonight, the atmosphere shifts, bringing a chance of snow showers in the evening, with light accumulations expected. As temperatures drop to around 17 degrees, dress warmly with layers, and consider a windproof jacket to combat the evening chill. While winter in Evanston typically features such conditions, today\u2019s cold snap serves as a reminder of the season's bite. For those considering outdoor activities, focus on enjoying the refreshing walk along the beach, perhaps making snowmen or savoring the scenic views over Lake Michigan, while keeping in mind the snow chance as night approaches.",
