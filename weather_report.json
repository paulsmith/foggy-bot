    "weather_report": "Evanston's current weather presents a brisk evening with temperatures hovering in the upper 20s, complemented by a gentle breeze that brings a chill to the air. The atmosphere is partly cloudy, setting a serene scene along the lakeshore. As night progresses, expect clouds to thicken, with overnight lows maintaining a steady chill, supported by light winds from the west-southwest. By Saturday, the weather shifts slightly with a forecast high in the low 40s and increasing cloud cover, as a more blustery southwesterly wind could stir up the lake.\n\nFor those venturing outdoors, the current conditions might feel slightly biting; hence, layering should be on the agenda. A warm coat, hat, and gloves will enhance comfort during brisk walks by Lake Michigan. While waves will be manageable under the somewhat cloudy conditions, any outdoor activities should keep in mind the chilly forecast as we transition to a new day. Though there are no immediate precipitation concerns, the cloud cover may lend a gray tone to the horizon, a reminder of the winter season upon us. As the calendar pushes forward into December, the temperatures are typical for this time of year in the Midwest.",
