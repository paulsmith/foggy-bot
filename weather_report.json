    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston paint a chilly and wintry scene, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s, making it feel quite brisk. The air is thick with moisture, adding a damp chill that many in the area will notice as they step outside. A blustery wind from the northeast stirs the atmosphere, suggesting a persistent winter vibe that won't let up easily. \n\nAs we look ahead, tonight brings likely snow showers, adding to the overcast skies, with lows dipping close to 26 degrees and temperatures rising slightly overnight. The gusts could reach up to 40 mph, making for an intense winter evening. Tomorrow, expect a continued chance of snow, with a high near 29 and a noticeable drop as the day goes on. Despite the promise of some snowfall, it seems the accumulation will be modest, with less than half an inch expected on Sunday. Those intending to venture outdoors would do well to bundle up and prepare for blustery, cold conditions; layering will be key to combatting the chill. Given the current season, these temperatures align well with what one would expect in mid-February, often characterized by frostbiting air and muted, gray skies. For those seeking activity, it might be best to stick to indoor pursuits or perhaps enjoy a brisk walk along the beach, where the waves will be agitated but the snowy landscape offers its own beauty.",
