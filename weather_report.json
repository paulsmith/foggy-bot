    "weather_report": "In Evanston, conditions are currently marked by a cool chill, with temperatures hovering in the low 50s and a robust wind sweeping from the northwest, lending a blustery edge to the day. The air is saturated, creating a damp atmosphere under a blanket of gray clouds that obscure the sun. As we look ahead, this afternoon promises a continuation of the cloudy weather with a slight dip in temperature, ultimately settling around 52 degrees. Winds will remain brisk, gusting up to 25 mph, ensuring a raw feeling as we transition into the evening where the temperature will fall to the upper 40s, still accompanied by a solid breeze.\n\nThe absence of precipitation indicates that while it may not be the sunniest day, it's not an especially wet one either. Wave conditions on Lake Michigan are likely to be gentle given the lack of significant storms, but the fierce winds could stir up some swells making the beach less inviting for the casual stroll. The overall presentation of the day is somewhat dreary, suggesting that warm layers are advisable for outdoor ventures\u2014knit hats and cozy jackets would be prudent attire. Given the time of year, these temperatures align with typical mid-November expectations, offering a stark reminder of autumn\u2019s grip. For those seeking activity, an indoor visit to a nearby cafe or museum may be preferable to a beach outing on this gray, gusty day.",
