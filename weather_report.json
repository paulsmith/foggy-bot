    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a crisp and cool morning, with temperatures nestled in the mid-30s and a gentle breeze coming in from the northwest. The skies are partly cloudy, suggesting a mix of sun and clouds throughout the day, though the overnight forecast indicates mostly cloudy skies with temperatures slowly rising to around 34 degrees. As for the waves on Lake Michigan, expect them to be relatively calm due to the lighter winds expected later.\n\nLooking ahead, the day will remain mostly cloudy with a high reaching into the low 30s, complemented by a gentle breeze. While there\u2019s no significant precipitation expected, the overall appearance may feel somewhat dreary and gray. It\u2019s advisable to dress warmly, perhaps in layers, with a good coat, gloves, and a hat to fend off the chill. Despite the cool atmosphere, the season is typical for December in this region, with temperatures aligning comfortably within expected ranges.\n\nThis gray day offers a perfect setting for indoor activities\u2014perhaps visiting local museums or enjoying a cozy caf\u00e9. For those feeling adventurous, a brisk walk along the lakefront could be refreshing, with the soothing sounds of the water providing a peaceful backdrop. Given the present conditions, it\u2019s best to plan accordingly and enjoy the charm of Evanston in wintertime.",
