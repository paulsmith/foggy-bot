    "weather_report": "In Evanston today, we're seeing a refreshing atmosphere with temperatures drifting around the mid to high 50s under mostly clear skies. The light, playful wind from the north-northwest adds a brisk energy to the air, making it feel a touch cooler but also invigorating. As the day unfolds, we can expect sunshine to prevail, though temperatures will gradually fall to the low 50s by the afternoon. Tonight, the clouds will roll in slightly, bringing a calmness to the night as we settle down to around the mid-40s, creating a gentle, pleasant ambiance for the evening.\n\nWith no precipitation on the horizon, the lakefront views invite outdoor activities. The water appears inviting with mild wave conditions, suitable for strolls along the beach or a peaceful moment by the pier. Given the current season, this weather feels quite typical for November in the Midwest, as the air carries a crispness that characterizes this time of year. I'd recommend layering up a bit\u2014perhaps a cozy sweater or light jacket\u2014for comfort while you enjoy the outdoors, especially if you're venturing out this evening. Whether it\u2019s a brisk walk or simply soaking in the serene lake views, today presents a wonderful opportunity to embrace the beauty of late fall in Evanston.",
