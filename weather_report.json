    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly afternoon marked by cloudy skies and a fierce breeze sweeping off Lake Michigan. The temperature hovers in the low 50s, while the air feels damp, creating a rather brisk atmosphere. As the day progresses, expect temperatures to cool further, dropping to the mid 40s, accompanied by a persistent west-southwest wind that may gust up to 25 mph. For tonight, the cloudy skies will remain, with temperatures settling around the freezing mark and a slight rise overnight.\n\nThe beach appears rather tranquil today, but the wave conditions, given the strong winds, could be choppy. There is no immediate precipitation expected, which keeps outdoor activities feasible, albeit chilly. As for attire, dressing in layers is recommended to fend off the biting wind. With the holiday season approaching, this afternoon is an opportune time for brisk walks along the shoreline or cozy gatherings indoors. Overall, while pleasantness may be somewhat limited due to the weather, the beauty of the lakeshore remains a delightful backdrop for winter activities.",
