    "weather_report": "The current weather in Evanston is characterized by a chill in the air, with temperatures settling in the mid 20s and a strong, brisk wind creating a biting sensation. The sky hangs heavy with clouds, suggesting a looming chance of snow showers this afternoon, echoing the wintery conditions typical for this time of year. As the day unfolds, temperatures are expected to barely reach into the upper 20s before dropping further into the low single digits by tonight, where wind chill values may plunge to a biting -13. \n\nWith the forecast calling for occasional snow showers and a blustery northwest wind gusting up to 35 mph, it would be wise to dress warmly in layered clothing, with a sturdy coat, hat, gloves, and insulated footwear. The wave conditions are likely choppy along Lake Michigan, making any water-related activities uninviting. This frost-laden day, blending cloudiness with a touch of snow, captures the essence of a typical February afternoon in the Midwest, a time when people often seek the warmth of indoors rather than the brisk embrace of the outdoors.",
