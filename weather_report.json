    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently experiencing crisp and cool conditions, with the temperature hovering in the low 20s and a blustery wind from the northwest. The mostly clear morning offers a serene view over Lake Michigan, with gentle waves lapping at the shore, making for a picturesque winter scene. As the day progresses, temperatures are expected to remain around the low to mid 20s, accompanied by a bright and mostly sunny sky, though they will dip further into the lower teens this evening. A wind chill will make it feel even colder, so outdoor enthusiasts should be prepared for a biting chill as the sun sets and temperatures drop.\n\nGiven these conditions, a warm coat, gloves, and a good hat are essential for anyone venturing outdoors. The relatively tranquil wave conditions might invite some onlookers to stroll along the beach or enjoy the view, yet the cold air is likely to keep most folks indoors. While today isn't marked by any significant holiday, the seasonal temperature is typical for early January in the Midwest, maintaining the region's characteristic chilly ambiance during winter.",
