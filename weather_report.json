    "weather_report": "As the clouds linger over Evanston, the weather this morning is characterized by cool and moist conditions, highlighted by a temperature in the upper 30s and a thick layer of fog wrapping around the landscape. With a blustery wind from the southeast gusting near 30 miles per hour, the shoreline presents a wild and somewhat dramatic view against the muted backdrop of Lake Michigan. The day's forecast offers a shift toward partly sunny skies with a high approaching the upper 40s, though a patchy drizzle is anticipated later, painting a picture of a typical late fall day in the Midwest.\n\nDespite the chill and the mist, this weather calls for a practical attire\u2014layers are essential: a warm coat, perhaps a scarf, and sturdy footwear if you plan to venture outside. As the temperatures gradually rise toward evening, an umbrella may come in handy due to a 50% chance of light rain in the later hours. This November day, while not quite ideal for outdoor leisure, remains a moment to appreciate the robust, ever-changing atmosphere of the season, inviting indoor activities or a brisk walk along the shoreline\u2014an opportunity to embrace the crispness of the air and the beauty of nature's transition.",
