    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Evanston, the landscape is shrouded in a veil of low-hanging clouds, hinting at the unsettled weather ahead. Scattered showers and thunderstorms are expected to plague the morning hours, lingering until about 1 PM. With gusty winds from the southwest, the air feels brisk, and the high temperature aims to reach a mild 66\u00b0F before easing into the cool embrace of the afternoon, where it will dip to around 51\u00b0F. For those venturing outside, be prepared for a real feel that may be significantly cooler due to the substantial gusts, with speeds soaring to 30 mph and gusts that can reach up to 50 mph. The chance of precipitation, lingering at a robust 70%, suggests that rain gear might be a prudent choice.\n\nAs the day unfolds, the cloud cover may break slightly, but expect the skies to remain mostly cloudy, while the breeze whips across Lake Michigan, churning the waters into a frosty tableau. Waves may appear rough today, reflecting the turbulent conditions as rain taps impatiently on rooftops and leaves flutter in the gusty winds. Tonight, conditions will settle to a partly cloudy lull, with temperatures dipping down to around 40\u00b0F, so a warm jacket will ensure comfort as the evening progresses. This day might be best spent indoors, perhaps enjoying a warm beverage while diving into a good book or catching up on some indoor hobbies \u2014 the weather invites a cozy retreat rather than outdoor escapades.",
