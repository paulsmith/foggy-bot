    "weather_report": "Evanston, Illinois, is waking up to chilly conditions this morning, with temperatures hovering in the mid-20s and a rather brisk wind creating a biting chill. The atmosphere is overcast, and a howling breeze from the west is rattling through the area, making it feel even cooler. As we look ahead to the day, expect intermittent snow showers before noon, transitioning into partly sunny skies by afternoon. Those high hopes might set in at around 26 degrees, but a retreat to 24 is also on the cards as the day wears on. With gusts occasionally reaching up to 30 mph, it\u2019s advisable to secure your hat as the wind makes for a rather fierce ballet with any loose articles.\n\nThis wintery scene suggests a rugged beauty along the shores of Lake Michigan, but it also means unpleasant wave conditions on the water. Today, precipitation chances remain low at around 20 percent, yet any falling snow could make surfaces slick. Ideal attire would be layered and warm\u2014think heavy coats, hats, and gloves\u2014to combat the bitter cold and wind. For those undeterred by the chill, a brisk walk along the beach or a cozy caf\u00e9 visit could make for delightful winter activities. November is well into winter in the Midwest, and temperatures like these are completely typical, urging a hasty retreat indoors as the holidays edge closer.",
