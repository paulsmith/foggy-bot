    "weather_report": "As the sun sets on this mid-November afternoon in Evanston, the temperature hovers in the low 50s, bringing a cool yet comfortable atmosphere. The day unfolds under a mostly cloudy sky, with those clouds lending a soft blanket over the horizon, creating a muted palette where Lake Michigan meets the shoreline. With a blustery south-southeast wind, expect gusts to reach up to 25 mph, rattling the leaves and sending a chill through the air. Wave conditions appear lively, stirring the lake slightly, making it a sight to behold from the beach.\n\nLooking ahead, the forecast indicates a continuation of these mild conditions, with temperatures gradually falling as evening approaches, dipping into the upper 40s. A slight chance of rain showers after midnight keeps the air crisp and fresh, ideal for an evening stroll along the waterfront\u2014but perhaps best enjoyed with a light jacket to fend off the cool breeze. The weather is typical for this time of year in the Midwest, as autumn transitions into the cooler months ahead. Given the day and time, those looking for fresh air might consider visiting nearby parks or enjoying a brisk walk by the water, where the playful winds and muted colors of the lake make for a charming, if slightly brisk, outing.",
