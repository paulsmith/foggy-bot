    "weather_report": "As dusk settles over Evanston, the air carries a brisk chill, hovering in the low 40s, accentuated by a fierce, howling wind from the northwest. The darkened beach presents a muted, cloudy scene that promises a night devoid of bright celestial beauty. Waves crash rhythmically against the shore, stirred up by the vigorous gusts, making for wildlife and shorebirds a rather tumultuous environment. Residents should prepare for a chilly evening with temperatures expected to dip into the high 30s, so bundling up in warm layers is advisable, perhaps with a windbreak to shield against the biting air.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, expect a continuation of the gray clouds, with temperatures just peeking to about 45 before slipping in the afternoon. The wind should settle into a more manageable pace, offering a gentler experience for those venturing outdoors. This is typical early winter weather for this region, though the fierce winds today certainly shine a spotlight on its occasionally tumultuous character. Given the conditions, indoor activities may be more appealing, perhaps a cozy gathering or visiting local shops in the ever-charming downtown Evanston, as the holiday season approaches.",
