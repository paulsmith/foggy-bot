    "weather_report": "As the early hours tick by in Evanston, the temperature nestles in the mid-30s, offering a brisk and somewhat chilly atmosphere. With the air feeling damp and the breeze stirring up from the west, conditions suggest a lingering freshness that might cause one to reach for a jacket. Much of the sky holds a graceful cloud cover, transitioning from mostly clear into the night, and as morning approaches on Tuesday, the forecast hints at cloudier skies with temperatures anticipated to climb only slightly through the day, peaking near 39 degrees. \n\nThe waves on Lake Michigan are likely influenced by the gusty winds, which could make for choppy conditions along the shore. No immediate precipitation is forecasted, allowing for outdoor activities, although it may feel quite cool and breezy. For those venturing out, layering up with a warm jacket and perhaps a hat would be prudent to withstand the brisk air. While this weather is typical for December in the Midwest, the coolness can still feel biting during evening hours. Nevertheless, opportunities for a scenic winter stroll along the shoreline or a quiet moment in one of Evanston\u2019s parks can be quite pleasing on this tranquil December night.",
