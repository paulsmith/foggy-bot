    "weather_report": "As the sun sets on Evanston, chilly conditions envelop the area with the temperature hovering in the low 20s. A brisk and blustery wind, originating from the south-southwest, adds a biting edge to the evening, making it feel even cooler. The atmosphere is mostly cloudy, casting a muted backdrop for the night ahead. There\u2019s a slight chance of snow showers this evening, mostly between 7 PM and midnight, though any accumulation is expected to be minimal\u2014just a dusting of less than half an inch, if anything at all.\n\nLooking ahead to Saturday, the forecast brings a promise of improvement with partly sunny skies and temperatures peaking in the mid-30s, falling later in the day. The winds will remain gentle yet gusty, continuing to whip through the region.  Given the current wintry season, these temperatures are rather typical for January in Illinois, embodying that characteristic chill. Dress warmly if venturing outdoors\u2014layered clothing, a sturdy coat, gloves, and a hat will provide comfort against the elements. Although outdoor activities are limited by the cold and potential light snow, a brisk walk along the beach could be refreshing for those undeterred by the chill.",
