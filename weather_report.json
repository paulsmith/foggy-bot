    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the day presents a cool, mildly brisk atmosphere with current conditions reflecting a temperature in the low 40s and a strong, gusty wind adding a sharp edge to the chill. The sky is mostly cloudy, lending a somewhat muted quality to the light, though clouds will make way for clearer skies this afternoon. Expect temperatures to rise, reaching the high 40s, accompanied by a southwest wind that will continue to howl, with gusts capable of lifting small objects. Tonight, temperatures will retreat into the mid-30s, under mostly clear skies, allowing for a pleasant stargazing opportunity if the winds calm down.\n\nAs for the waves along Lake Michigan, conditions are likely to be lively given the wind's intensity. While there\u2019s no rain forecasted today, the notable winds will create some challenging conditions on the water. Given the chill in the air and the blustery atmosphere, layering up is essential\u2014think warm jackets, hats, and gloves to stay comfortable. This temperature is typical for this time of year in this region, as winter continues to grip the area. Outdoor activities may be limited, but the inviting winter sunlight could provide a great opportunity for brisk walks by the lake or enjoying local coffee shops. Although there are no holidays today, the weekend spirit is palpable in the air, encouraging residents to embrace the season.",
