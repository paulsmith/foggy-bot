    "weather_report": "As the clock ticks past one in the morning in Evanston, the air carries a crisp, slightly damp chill with the temperature hovering in the mid-40s. The breeze is gentle, whispering softly through the night, while clouds drift lazily overhead, obscuring the stars. Despite the calm at this moment, there are murmurs of change on the horizon. The forecast for Sunday calls for a more unsettled atmosphere, with rain showers likely to roll in after noon, suggesting a day where the clouds will dominate. As temperatures push towards the low 60s, the air is expected to feel a bit muggy, particularly with increasing humidity slated for the afternoon. Wind from the southeast will pick up a bit, reaching a blustery feel, with occasional gusts adding a sense of urgency as you gaze out over Lake Michigan.\n\nGiven the forecast, it's wise to dress in layers, opting for a light waterproof jacket and comfortable footwear, as the chance of rain is significant. If you plan to venture outdoors, especially towards the beach or waterfront, be prepared for a potentially blustery afternoon with the surf likely kicking up a bit as winds intensify. While this time of year can be brisk in the Chicago area, the upcoming high temperatures are somewhat typical for early November. Activities may be best enjoyed under shelter\u2014perhaps a cozy caf\u00e9 or museum visit\u2014rather than at the water\u2019s edge, with the promise of rain rolling in as the day unfolds.",
