    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reflect a chilly, damp evening with temperatures hovering in the mid-30s, accompanied by a steady, fierce wind from the southeast. Light rain creates a somber atmosphere, adding a layer of gloom as the light diminishes. The weather forecast suggests continued rain through the night, with patches of fog likely to settle in, making visibility uncertain. As temperatures gradually rise to the high 30s overnight, the chill in the air will persist, combining with moisture to create a rather uncomfortable feel outdoors.\n\nWith tomorrow's forecast bringing cloudy skies and lingering drizzle, the high will only reach around the low 40s. Wave conditions along Lake Michigan may be somewhat choppy, influenced by the gusty winds that could whip up a spray. Given the dampness and cool temperatures typical for mid-December in this region, residents are advised to don warm, waterproof attire if venturing outside. While this evening's weather is hardly ideal for outdoor activities, tomorrow's drizzly conditions might still allow for a brisk walk along the lakeshore, albeit with an umbrella at hand. As we approach the year's end, the chill certainly fits the seasonal pattern, albeit a reminder of the winter months ahead.",
