    "weather_report": "In Evanston this morning, the temperature sits comfortably in the low 30s, offering a decidedly chilly feel as the air carries a bit of dampness. Currently, the conditions are clear, though there's a shift expected later in the day. By afternoon, skies will change as rain showers loom on the horizon, with a forecasted high around the mid-50s before slipping back into the upper 30s this evening. The wind will pick up from the southwest, creating a gentle breeze that may whip up on occasion, but initially, it feels quite still.\n\nAs waves roll gently toward the shore, conditions at Lake Michigan today may start off calm; however, with the increasing winds and impending rain, a rippling surface could develop later. The chance of precipitation spikes to 80% tonight, so it\u2019s wise to carry an umbrella or wear a waterproof jacket if venturing outside. With the ground softening under the threat of rain, discerning outdoor activities might be better suited for the morning hours. Given that it\u2019s the last day of January, the weather feels typical for this time of year, though many might wish for a touch more warmth. With Valentine\u2019s Day approaching, thoughts of cozy indoor activities might be on the minds of many, making today just a prelude to the season of warmth to come.",
