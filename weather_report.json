    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Evanston, the current conditions present a cool and murky atmosphere, marked by light drizzle and a thick veil of fog. With the temperature hovering in the upper 40s, accompanied by a persistent mist, the sensation outside feels damp and chilly, creating a rather gritty start to the day. Wind from the southwest is stirring briskly, adding to the briskness of the air, while the waves on Lake Michigan are likely disturbed, echoing the current weather\u2019s intensity.\n\nLooking ahead, the forecast offers a mix of clouds and fleeting moments of sunshine, promising a high near the low 50s later today. Winds will remain noticeable, though not as fierce as the early hours, shifting to a more manageable gust. The chance of precipitation lingers into the morning, albeit with just a slight chance for additional rain later. In this wintry season, temperatures are typical for early December in the Midwest, transitioning well into the year-end holiday mood. The dampness outside may suggest indoor activities would be more appealing today, perhaps exploring local cafes or art galleries rather than braving the beach. Given the cool, misty conditions, dressing in layers with a waterproof jacket and sturdy footwear is advisable for any brave souls venturing out today.",
