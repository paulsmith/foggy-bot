    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chill in the air, with temperatures resting in the low single digits alongside a biting breeze. Although partly cloudy, the day carries with it an unmistakable briskness that could lead to a few flurries later on. Residents can expect a significant uptick in cloud cover as we move through the afternoon, with temperatures only reaching the high 20s. Wind chill values may plunge to uncomfortable levels, reminding everyone that February in the Midwest demands warm attire.\n\nAs we transition into the evening, snow is likely to blanket the area, making for slippery roads and potential accumulations of 1 to 3 inches. The snow's arrival brings a quieter, cozy feel to the winter landscape, but caution is advised when venturing outside. Given the notable chill, warm layers, sturdy boots, and perhaps a waterproof outer jacket will be essential for anyone braving the elements. This weather certainly reflects winter\u2019s peak in the Midwest, as temperatures are on par with what one would expect for this time of year. While outdoor activities might be limited due to the impending snowfall, indoor pursuits or a warming visit to a local caf\u00e9 could be delightful options, especially as today also marks Valentine\u2019s Day, an occasion celebrated by many.",
