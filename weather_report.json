    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently experiencing a crisp and cool evening, with temperatures nestled in the low 40s and a gentle breeze blowing in from the south. The clear skies of the day offer a pleasant view towards Lake Michigan, although clouds are expected to gather later, heralding a shift in the weather. As night falls, scattered showers are forecasted to arise after 3 AM, with a low dipping to around the mid-30s. The winds will soften to a light pace, making for a relatively calm night ahead.\n\nLooking to tomorrow, expect a continuation of the cool and cloudy conditions, as scattered rain showers will be prevalent before noon, giving way to patchy drizzle. With highs climbing to near 50 before sliding back into the 40s by afternoon, it is advisable to dress warmly and consider a rainproof layer, given the likelihood of wet conditions. While the temperatures are typical for this time of year in the Midwest, the choppy waters of the lake may create rough wave conditions. Despite the dreary forecast, an invigorating walk along the beach could be refreshing, though outdoor plans should definitely account for the risk of precipitation.",
