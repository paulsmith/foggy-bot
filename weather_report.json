    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston paint a scene of crisp coolness, with temperatures lingering in the low 40s and a gentle wind creating a brisk atmosphere. The sky is mostly clear, offering an unobstructed view of the vastness of Lake Michigan but accompanied by a slightly invigorating chill. As we move into the overnight hours, skies will remain partly cloudy, with temperatures settling near the upper 30s, while a light breeze swings in from the west-southwest.\n\nFor Sunday, residents can look forward to mostly sunny skies, ushering in a rise in temperatures that will peak near the mid-50s. A soft and pleasant warmth can be anticipated as the day unfolds, accompanied by a light breeze. Given the seasonal chill typical for early December in this region, temperatures are right on par, though they still demand a warm layer or two for comfort. Those wishing to take advantage of the afternoon sun might find the conditions favorable for a leisurely stroll along the lakefront or perhaps a visit to one of the local parks. With no precipitation expected and only gentle wave action on Lake Michigan, it indeed seems like an ideal day to embrace the outdoors.",
