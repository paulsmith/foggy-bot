    "weather_report": "The current chill in Evanston, where temperatures hover in the mid-teens, presents an unmistakable bite typical of a January morning. Clarity is high, with the sky embracing a mix of clouds that hang low over the picturesque beach, creating a stark contrast against the smooth, glistening surface of Lake Michigan, gently fringed by crisp, rolling waves stirred by a substantial, blustery wind. As we move into the day, expect a chance of snow later this afternoon, with temperatures anticipated to rise, reaching the upper 20s. The likelihood of snow increases tonight as the temperatures rise again, creating a scene both invigorating and potentially messy with expected accumulations.\n\nWhile the current conditions might deter casual strolls along the shore, if you venture out, layering up is essential. A warm coat, gloves, and a sturdy hat will provide necessary protection against the cold and gusty winds. The wintry mix of conditions suggests that outdoor activities should lean towards brief excursions rather than prolonged outings. Given the typical Midwest chill of January, today\u2019s weather aligns well with seasonal expectations, making it a reminder of winter\u2019s firm grip. With the landscape dressed in its frosty attire, it's an ideal time for indoor leisure or a cozy gathering ahead, rather than extensive outdoor plans.",
