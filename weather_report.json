    "weather_report": "As night settles over Evanston, the temperature is hovering in the low 20s, making for a brisk, invigorating atmosphere. With a gentle breeze flowing from the west-northwest at about 10 mph, occasional gusts stir the air, creating a slight chill that reminds us of the season. The night\u2019s sky remains mostly clear, allowing for a peaceful and tranquil view, with minimal cloud cover enhancing the visibility of the stars. Wave conditions on Lake Michigan may be moderate, hinting at some movement in the water, though no precipitation is expected this evening.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, residents can anticipate mostly sunny conditions with daytime highs reaching into the mid-30s. While the temperatures will dip to around 30 degrees in the afternoon, the light winds and bright sky should make for a pleasant winter day. This weather is typical for early December in the Midwest\u2014cold yet bearable, perfect for winter activities. For those venturing outside, it would be wise to bundle up in warm layers, perhaps donning a cozy coat, hat, and gloves, to fully enjoy the brisk air. Given the seasonal chill, a stroll along the shoreline or a casual visit to local shops would be delightful choices for the day, allowing for enjoyment of both the beautiful winter landscape and the community spirit typical of this time of year.",
