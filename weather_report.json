    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a very chilly evening, with temperatures in the low 20s and a brisk, blustery wind sweeping in from the west at 15 to 25 mph, making it feel significantly colder. The sky is mostly cloudy, enveloping the area in a muted, grayish hue. As the night progresses, expect partly cloudy skies with a drop in temperature to around the mid-teens. Wind chill could plummet to zero, suggesting that outdoor activity will require adequate layering to stave off the biting cold.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, Saturday offers a promising shift with sunshine emerging during the day, although temperatures are expected to peak in the low 20s before falling slightly in the afternoon. Wind chill values may dip as low as negative one, so maintaining warmth will be essential. As for wave conditions along Lake Michigan, the current brisk winds suggest some rough patches, but minimal precipitation is anticipated, granting a clear passage for outdoor ventures. Given the season's typical frigid character, these temperatures align closely with what one might expect in late November in this region. Those venturing out should consider donning heavy winter coats, hats, and gloves, especially if participating in outdoor activities such as walking by the beach or braving the cold for some crisp air in the evening.",
