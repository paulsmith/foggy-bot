    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a chilly evening, with temperatures settling in the low 20s and a brisk breeze from the south southwest, imparting a sharp edge to the air. The scene outside is mostly cloudy, casting a muted pallor over the landscape. Expect the day to offer moments of partial sun amidst the clouds, but temperatures will gradually drop into the high teens as the afternoon unfolds. Tonight, there's a slight chance of snow showers, mainly in the early evening, with an opportunity for little more than a dusting. The wind may gust at times, adding a wild element to the chilly atmosphere. \n\nWith icy conditions at the beach, the waves may rise slightly under these conditions, but the expectation remains mainly calm along the shores. For those venturing outside, layered clothing is advisable\u2014think warm jackets, hats, and gloves to combat the chill. This weather is typical for a January day in this region, where stark winter reveals its icy grasp. Given the current climate, cozy indoor activities may be preferable, yet a brisk walk by Lake Michigan could refresh hardened spirits looking to embrace the cold. Today marks an ordinary day in January, with no significant holidays looming on the horizon.",
