    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly and damp atmosphere, with temperatures hovering in the mid-30s and a heavy layer of clouds obscuring the skies. With calm winds currently in play, the shoreline along Lake Michigan presents a serene yet brisk view. As night falls, moisture in the air foreshadows the likelihood of snow emerging after midnight, with temperatures expected to dip slightly, settling around the low 30s. Wind gusts are anticipated to pick up later, adding a slight bite to the cold.\n\nLooking ahead to Wednesday, residents might catch a glimpse of sunshine, albeit fleeting, with a slight chance of early morning snow. Temperatures will lower further into the low 30s throughout the day, accompanied by a gentle to brisk northwesterly breeze. The combination of overcast skies and occasional snow could make for a gloomy yet picturesque winter scene. Those venturing outdoors should don warm layers, including hats and gloves, to withstand the chilly air, making for a cozy indoor day unless a brisk walk by the lake calls. This week's forecast embodies the essence of a typical Chicago winter, where cold, damp air prevails as the season approaches its peak.",
