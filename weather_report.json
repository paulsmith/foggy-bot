    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly atmosphere, with temperatures lingering in the lower 20s and a noticeable breeze from the northwest, creating a brisk environment. The air feels crisp, making it best for bundled layers if you venture outside. As the day progresses, mostly sunny skies will bring some warmth, rising to near 25, though temperatures will dip back into the low teens tonight, presenting a remarkable wind chill factor that could make it feel as frigid as 1 degree. There are no chances of precipitation, ensuring a dry canvas against the backdrop of Lake Michigan.\n\nWave heights along the shore may be moderate due to the winds, inviting those interested in the nuanced dance of water but discouraging any swimming. This late February day is marked by typical winter conditions for the region, yet a beautiful respite in brightness. Ideal outdoor activities include bundled walks along the beach or enjoying a warm drink at a local caf\u00e9. There are no major holidays today, but with the weekend approaching, you might want to keep an eye on upcoming events in the vibrant Chicago area.",
