    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a chilly scene, with temperatures hovering in the low 40s, giving a brisk feel to the air. The day is mostly cloudy, casting a muted light over the shoreline as the wind whistles gently from the southwest at about 17 miles an hour. With no precipitation expected this evening and a barometer of partly cloudy skies ahead, the night will settle in around the mid-30s, still keeping that brisk vibe alive. Tomorrow, expect temperatures to climb cautiously to just below 50, with the afternoon promising a gradual drop back into the mid-40s, likely inviting a cozy atmosphere indoors.\n\nThe beach may look inviting, but the wave conditions will likely be choppy\u2014stay mindful if venturing out near the water. For those looking to enjoy this late February day, dressing warmly in layers will be key, as the temperatures reflect typical late winter weather for the Midwest. Though not a major holiday weekend, it\u2019s still a fine time to take a brisk walk along the lakeshore, enjoy the crisp air, or perhaps visit a local caf\u00e9 to warm up with a steaming cup.",
