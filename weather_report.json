    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Evanston, the air carries a crisp chill, with temperatures settling in the mid-40s and moisture enhancing that brisk feeling. The sky is mostly cloudy, casting a dim light over the beach area, which is currently free from any precipitation but with a hint of rain expected overnight. The breeze is gusty, rattling through the trees and perhaps stirring up some waves along the shore. \n\nLooking ahead to the day, rain is likely to arrive before morning commutes, transitioning to a chance of showers that could pepper the rest of the day. Expect a high in the upper 40s, with temperatures gradually falling in the afternoon, all accompanied by brisk winds that will make it feel even cooler. In this late autumn setting, the weather is slightly below seasonal norms for late November, yet not entirely unexpected for this time of year. \n\nGiven these conditions, it\u2019s wise to dress warmly in layers, perhaps opting for a waterproof jacket should the rain sweep through as predicted. While the beach may not seem inviting for a swim, a refreshing walk along the shore could be a brisk way to enjoy the season\u2019s charm, provided one is prepared for variable conditions. It's a typical day in November, where the chill reminds us that winter is inching closer.",
