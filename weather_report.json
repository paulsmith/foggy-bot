    "weather_report": "As darkness descends over Evanston this evening, the temperature holds in the low 50s, accompanied by a gentle, yet brisk breeze from the southeast. The atmosphere feels notably moist and quite cool, setting the stage for the rain that is predicted to begin shortly. With the clouds thickening above, the prospect of a heavy downpour looms, with forecasts suggesting significant precipitation throughout the night, creating an ambiance more suited for indoor activities.\n\nMoving into Thursday, expect a continuation of the gloomy conditions, with rain likely lingering until the afternoon. The high will peak just above the low 50s, before a gradual drop in temperature occurs, ushered in by a shift to a milder west-northwest wind. As waves churn on nearby Lake Michigan, conditions may prove rough, making it uninviting for outdoor marine activities. Given the current season, these temperatures are typical for mid-November in the Midwest, though the dampness combined with wind may render the evening chillier than it appears at first glance. Attire recommendations lean toward layers\u2014sweaters or light jackets paired with waterproof outerwear\u2014ideal for braving the wet and blustery conditions. Indoor pursuits, such as exploring local cafes or attending community events, would be the best choices to enjoy this November evening.",
