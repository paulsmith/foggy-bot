    "weather_report": "As this afternoon unfolds in Evanston, the weather showcases charming autumnal clarity, with the temperature hovering in the mid-50s and a gentle touch of humidity that lends a crisp feeling to the air. A blustery southeast wind adds a lively energy to the scene, while the beach offers a picturesque view of Lake Michigan, undisturbed by any precipitation. The clouds are mostly scattered, allowing patches of sky to peek through, promising no surprises in the form of rain or storms.\n\nLooking ahead, tonight will bring a transition to a mostly cloudy sky, with temperatures dipping into the upper 40s. The southeast wind will persist, providing a brisk backdrop and gusts that could catch you by surprise. Given these conditions, it's advisable to layer up with a light jacket if venturing out, particularly along the shoreline where breezes can be more pronounced. The wave conditions appear manageable, perfect for a peaceful evening stroll or perhaps a quiet moment watching the waters. As autumn settles in, the coolness of the season is unmistakable, inviting outdoor activities like a leisurely walk, a visit to the local parks, or simply enjoying the beauty of the declining day. While the landscape may not be bustling with holiday festivities, the tranquility of the beach enhances the serenity of this typical November day. \n\nColor representation for today\u2019s weather:",
