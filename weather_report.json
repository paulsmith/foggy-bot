    "weather_report": "Currently in Evanston, the atmosphere feels crisp and cool, with temperatures hovering in the low 50s. A strong, gusty wind sweeps in from the southwest, creating an invigorating chill in the air. As the day progresses, expect a shift towards partly sunny skies, but temperatures will gradually dip, reaching a high near 50, before settling around the mid 40s by evening. As the sun sets, patchy fog is anticipated, accompanied by a slight chance of rain later tonight, hinting at the clouds that blanket the sky.\n\nDespite the potential for rain later, the landscape maintains a somewhat dreary charm. The waves on Lake Michigan are slightly turbulent, making the beach less inviting for typical outdoor activities. Given these conditions, light layers along with a waterproof jacket are advisable for those venturing outside. This time of year, temperatures generally trend towards the 30s and 40s, making today\u2019s readings characteristic of winter in this region, though slightly above the normal chill. With the holiday season upon us, today offers a moment to appreciate the serene beauty of winter, even with the prospect of rain on the horizon.",
