    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reflect a chilly and damp atmosphere, with temperatures falling in the low 40s and a thick layer of clouds overhead. The stillness of the air belies the expected south winds that will pick up later in the day, adding a brisk quality to the afternoon as temperatures rise to the high 50s. As night approaches, there's a slight chance of rain showers after 3 a.m., but the overall precipitation risk remains low for the day. The beach, looking out toward Lake Michigan, presents a gray and muted backdrop; the water may be relatively calm but could also show slight movement with the gentle breezes that will develop. \n\nGiven the dampness and cooler temperatures, recommended attire includes warm layers, perhaps a light jacket or sweater, along with comfortable footwear for any outdoor activities. This time of year, as late fall settles into winter, the temperatures are consistent with typical ranges for the region. Visitors may enjoy a brisk walk along the beach or through local parks, relishing the fresh air, despite the grayness. While it\u2019s not a holiday today, as the season progresses, plans for upcoming festivities could be in the air.",
