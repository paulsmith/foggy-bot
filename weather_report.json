    "weather_report": "Evanston's current weather is marked by a chill in the air, with temperatures lingering in the low 20s and a brisk wind sweeping through at a fierce pace, making it feel even colder. The sky is mostly cloudy, giving an overcast feel that might make for a rather dreary morning. Thankfully, the forecast for the day indicates a transition to mostly sunny weather, with the high expected to reach the low 30s before flattening out to around 27 this afternoon. Tonight, clear skies will prevail, allowing temperatures to dip to near 20, accompanied by a steady west-southwest breeze that could become gusty.\n\nAs for how it looks outside, the overall scene is somewhat bleak but refreshing; ideal for a brisk walk if you're dressed warmly. There is no precipitation in sight, and wave conditions along Lake Michigan should be relatively calm given the absence of storms, making it a suitable day for coastal strolls, provided you're bundled up adequately. With this wintry scene playing out in late January, temperatures are on the cooler end of the spectrum, typical for this season in the Midwest. Consider wearing layers, a thick winter coat, hat, and gloves if venturing out. While it\u2019s not a festive holiday today, it\u2019s a fine time for introspection or leisurely walks along the shoreline, inviting moments of solitude away from the hustle and bustle of daily life.",
