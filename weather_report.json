    "weather_report": "Current weather conditions in Evanston are chilly, with a temperature hovering around the mid-20s. The atmosphere feels quite brisk due to the wind, which is coming from the southeast at a moderate pace, creating a noticeable chill in the air. The sky is mostly cloudy, casting a grayish hue over the landscape, and there's an indication of some light snow on the horizon. Predictions suggest that overnight temperatures will dip slightly more, and residents might see intermittent snow showers, particularly towards the early morning hours. \n\nAs the day unfolds tomorrow, expect continued cloudy skies with temperatures climbing just a bit, peaking around the upper 20s. While conditions for outdoor pleasure might be limited due to the cold and potential for snow, it\u2019s a good idea to bundle up in warm layers, grab a hat, and perhaps enjoy a cozy indoor activity. Wave conditions along Lake Michigan are likely moderate due to the wind, making it less than ideal for any water activities. All in all, while today may not invite one outdoors, it still holds the charm of a classic winter day in the Midwest, reminding us that the season is still very much in command.",
