    "weather_report": "As night settles over Evanston, conditions are cool and a bit blustery, with the temperature hovering in the low 40s and humidity creating a crisp atmosphere. The north wind, while vigorous, brings a touch of chill, making it feel fresher near the lakeshore. Cloudy skies blanket the area, setting a grey tone for the evening, and there's a slight chance of rain showers emerging in the early hours, although nothing substantial is expected. \n\nLooking ahead to the day, the weather is set to improve slightly, transitioning to mostly sunny skies with the mercury rising to the high 40s by mid-afternoon. Given the cool air, a gentle breeze will continue, so layers will be essential. The current season is typical for November in the Midwest, where cooler days and evenings are the norm. Those looking to enjoy the outdoors might consider a brisk walk by the lake or a quick jog along the park paths, keeping an eye on the weather for any light rain that could dampen plans later tonight. Dress warmly, and enjoy the serene beauty of Evanston as it prepares for a unique late autumn day.",
