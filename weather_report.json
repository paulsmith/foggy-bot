    "weather_report": "Evanston, Illinois, is currently enveloped in a damp atmosphere, with light rain falling and a temperature lingering in the mid 60s. The air is heavy with humidity, making for a muggy sensation, while gusts of wind create a blustery feel along the shore. As we look forward to the rest of the day, rain showers are expected to continue, with cloud cover dominating the sky. A high near the mid 60s is anticipated, dipping slightly in the afternoon. With wind whipping in from the south-southwest, gusts could climb to 40 mph, and there's a significant chance of additional rainfall.\n\nThe beach scene presents a somewhat somber look\u2014overcast skies and wild waves crashing against the shore offer a dramatic coastal view. Those venturing outside today should prepare for wet conditions; a light rain jacket or umbrella is advisable, combined with comfortable layers suitable for the dip in temperatures tonight, which are expected to fall to the mid 40s. With the moisture in the air and the chill settling in, outdoor activities may be less appealing. Instead, this could be a good day for cozy indoor pursuits, perhaps at a local caf\u00e9 or library, enjoying the quiet charm of Evanston on a rainy day.",
