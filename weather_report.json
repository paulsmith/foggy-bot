    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly atmosphere with temperatures in the low 50s, accompanied by a blustery wind sweeping in from the east. The air holds a damp chill that suggests a cozy evening in\u2014perfect for curling up indoors. As darkness settles, clouds blanket the sky, setting the stage for scattered showers expected later tonight. Rain will likely start to fall between 11 PM and 3 AM, with a modest chance of continued drizzle into the morning hours.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the weather will remain overcast with rain showers intermittently dotting the day, keeping conditions cool as afternoon temperatures dip to the mid 40s. The waves on Lake Michigan may be somewhat choppy, with the brisk winds adding a bit of a kick to the lake's surface. For those venturing outside, a light rain jacket and perhaps a warm sweater would be wise attire, as the season typically brings such brisk, damp conditions. While this weather is typical for late November in the Midwest, it leans more toward the uninviting end of the comfort spectrum, nudging residents to seek indoor activities rather than braving the elements. As the long holiday weekend nears its close, many might prefer to gather indoors or plan for festivities in warm, welcoming spaces.",
