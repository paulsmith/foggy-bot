    "weather_report": "As dawn approaches in Evanston, current conditions reveal a chilly atmosphere with temperatures nestled in the mid to high teens, complemented by a gentle breeze from the west. The dry, mostly clear sky allows for a hint of moonlight to illuminate the serene landscape, creating a tranquil setting by Lake Michigan. As we look ahead to the day, expect mostly sunny skies with temperatures rising into the high 20s by afternoon, reminiscent of a typical early December day in the Midwest where the crisp air kisses the skin.\n\nWaves along the lakeshore may be a bit brisk, but no significant precipitation is anticipated, ensuring a pleasant duration for any outdoor activities. Dressing warmly in layers, perhaps with a cozy hat and gloves, would be advisable to navigate the refreshing chill. This calm winter morning invites opportunities for a leisurely stroll along the shoreline or a brisk walk through the nearby parks, attending to the natural beauty that winter has to offer. As this is not a holiday, it seems poised to be a perfect day for some peaceful reflection in nature before the holiday season draws near.",
