    "weather_report": "In Evanston this morning, the atmosphere is decidedly brisk, with temperatures lingering in the low 50s under a blanket of clouds, giving the shoreline a somewhat muted appearance as it stretches toward Lake Michigan. A strong, gusty wind sweeps through the area, making for a rather blustery scene along the beach, while the humidity lingers, imparting a damp chill to the air. For the day ahead, while mostly sunny skies are on the horizon, we can expect a gradual decline in temperatures, dipping into the mid 40s by afternoon. As evening sets in, temperatures may rise slightly but will settle around the low 40s.\n\nThe wave conditions are likely moderate given today\u2019s breezy winds, perfect for a brisk walk or jog along the shoreline to enjoy the fresh air, though anyone considering water activities should do so with caution. Currently, there\u2019s no precipitation on the radar, so it seems rain is not a concern today. Donning layers is advisable; a warm jacket and perhaps a scarf would provide comfort against the cool breezes. In the spirit of Veterans Day, it\u2019s a fine opportunity to honor those who served, perhaps through reflective activities like a peaceful stroll or gathering with friends and family. Overall, while the day may start cloudy, don\u2019t miss the chance to relish the sunshine later on.",
