    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather presents a brisk scene, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s, creating a distinctly wintry atmosphere. The air carries a chill, accentuated by a blustery wind swirling in from the west-northwest at a fierce pace, making outdoor conditions feel significantly colder. The sky is dominated by clouds, with a forecasted chance of snow showers later today. As the afternoon progresses, expect temperatures to drop further, approaching the low 20s, while gusts may reach up to 40 mph, promising a blustery end to the day.\n\nLooking ahead, the evening will bring scattered snow showers, transitioning to clearer skies by late night, with temperatures dipping dangerously close to the single digits. Wind chill could exacerbate the cold, with values feeling like -14. Given the biting conditions, it's advisable to bundle up in warm layers, perhaps a heavy coat, insulated gloves, and a hat to shield against the penetrating cold. Wave conditions on Lake Michigan are likely to be choppy due to the strong winds, though mainly calm at the moment. The coastal scene may appear strikingly beautiful but quite inhospitable for outdoor activities; hence, this is a perfect time to cozy up indoors with warm drinks, or prepare for a brisk winter walk if suitably attired. With winter firmly in grip and the holiday season approaching, this weather summons a sense of cozy gatherings indoors as we approach winter festivities.",
