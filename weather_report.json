    "weather_report": "Evanston is waking up to brisk and chilly conditions, with the current temperature hovering in the low 10s, accompanied by a noticeable wind that sends a sharp bite through the air. The sky is clear, offering a pristine view, but those venturing outdoors should be prepared for gusty breezes that add to the chill. As the day unfolds, we can expect bright sunshine, with the temperature gradually rising through the day. The high is projected to reach the low 30s, dipping slightly in the afternoon. \n\nTonight, the scene remains clear as temperatures settle into the mid-teens, providing a crisp atmosphere perfect for bundled up evening strolls. The waves along Lake Michigan are bound to be stirred by the winds, so caution is advised for those considering time by the shore. There is no precipitation on the horizon, ensuring dry conditions throughout the day. For attire, a warm coat, hat, and gloves are essential to withstand the cool air. Given that it's February, these temperatures align well with typical winter conditions for the region. As the weekend approaches, consider engaging in indoor activities or taking a brisk walk along the beach to enjoy the wintry scenery before the spring thaw.",
