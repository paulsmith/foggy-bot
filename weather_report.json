    "weather_report": "In Evanston, current conditions present a brisk evening with temperatures hovering in the mid-20s and a notable breeze sweeping in from the south-southwest, adding a touch of chill to the air. Clouds blanket the sky, contributing to a somewhat dim ambiance as night falls. Tonight, expect mostly cloudy skies, with temperatures gradually rising towards the upper 20s. Although the winds remain fairly strong, they will ease slightly by nightfall, gusting to about 35 mph at times.\n\nLooking ahead to Wednesday, the weather will continue to be predominantly cloudy, with isolated snow showers likely in the early afternoon before transitioning to scattered rain and snow. Daytime highs are predicted to reach the mid-30s, but temperatures may dip to the low 30s by late afternoon. With a 40% chance of precipitation and minimal snow accumulation expected, it will be best to prepare for damp conditions. Given the chilly feel tonight and the forecasted precipitation, a warm coat, gloves, and waterproof footwear would be prudent for anyone venturing outdoors. \n\nAs December unfolds, these temperatures characterize typical winter conditions in the Midwest, though they may lean slightly towards the cooler side for this time of year. With the evening hours ahead, finding indoor activities or cozy spots by the fireplace would be a welcome way to appreciate the season, rather than braving the elements.",
