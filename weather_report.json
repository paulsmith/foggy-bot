    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current conditions present a chilly scene with temperatures just above 15 degrees accompanied by a brisk wind. The air feels sharp and cutting, as the wind whispers from the northwest at a notable pace, making for a rather brisk evening. The sky is cloaked in clouds, offering a muted appearance to the surroundings, further contributing to the winter chill. Tonight, the forecast suggests things will drop even lower, settling around 9 degrees, with wind chill driving the feels-like temperature down to -2. \n\nLooking ahead to Friday, the weather will provide a welcome shift as partly sunny skies emerge, showcasing a high reaching the low 30s. This will be a stark contrast to the current scene, providing more livable temperatures, albeit still on the cool side, with a gentle breeze out of the northeast. The waters of Lake Michigan will likely be moderately choppy, but no significant precipitation is expected. As for attire, layering is essential: a warm coat, hat, and gloves are a must for tonight\u2019s frigid air, while tomorrow might allow for a lighter jacket as the day brightens. Given that it\u2019s the second week of December, these temperatures are fitting for the region, but they remind us of the striking chill typical of a Midwestern winter. Outdoor activities should be limited as the cold sets in, but if you're brave enough, a brisk walk by the beach could invigorate your spirit as the season unfolds.",
