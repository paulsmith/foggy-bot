    "weather_report": "Currently in Evanston, it's a chilly and damp night, with temperatures lingering in the low 40s. The air is heavy with fog and mist, making visibility quite poor as winds blow from the south at a brisk pace. As we look ahead to the day, a continuation of these murky conditions is expected. Areas of fog will linger overnight, accompanied by a chance of rain that might add a touch more moisture to the already saturated ground. The forecast suggests a cloudy Monday with highs reaching into the upper 40s, before cooling back down throughout the afternoon.\n\nIn terms of aesthetic appeal, the scene is likely to feel quite dreary, with the combination of mist and clouds giving a muted appearance to what should be a vibrant beach view. The waves on Lake Michigan are expected to be moderate but likely choppy due to the winds, which could be rough for small craft. Given the conditions, an umbrella or a light raincoat would be wise to carry, along with warm clothing to fend off the chill. This weather is typical for mid-December in the Midwest, where the temperatures reflect the onset of winter\u2019s embrace. While outdoor activities might be limited, it could still be a good opportunity for a brisk walk along the beach\u2014just be prepared for getting a bit damp.",
