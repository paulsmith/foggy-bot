    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly scene, with temperatures hovering in the low teens and a noticeable wind adding a sharp edge to the air, creating a brisk atmosphere. With a strong northwestern breeze, outdoor activities may feel invigorating but somewhat biting, especially near the waterfront areas. The day holds promise for partly sunny skies, gradually warming to a high in the mid-20s. As the afternoon progresses, temperatures will dip slightly, presenting a wintry feel that encourages well-layered attire\u2014cozy coats, hats, and gloves are recommended.\n\nThe lakeshore could be choppy due to the gusty winds, potentially generating moderate waves, while the absence of precipitation keeps the day dry. Given the winter season\u2019s nature here in the Midwest, these temperatures are typical, allowing for vibrant seasonal activities. A brisk walk along the beach, exploring local caf\u00e9s, or engaging in winter sports remains inviting despite the currently cold and breezy conditions. Today is a regular Tuesday, devoid of notable holidays, but the chill in the air and hints of sunshine may still beckon locals to enjoy the beauty of winter in Evanston.",
