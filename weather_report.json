    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the evening brings a cool and somewhat damp atmosphere, with temperatures in the low 50s, complemented by a light breeze from the south southeast. The air feels slightly muggy, wrapped in a blanket of clouds that shroud the city. Currently, you can expect scattered rain showers that will persist into the early morning hours, easing into drizzle later on. The chance of precipitation stands at 40%, hinting at a night that may be filled with gentle patter against windows.\n\nLooking ahead to Monday, the forecast indicates a continuation of this overcast trend, with cloudy skies and the potential for occasional drizzle throughout the day. The mercury is expected to hover near the 50-degree mark, with a slight decline into the afternoon. A blustery wind could stir up some waves on Lake Michigan, making for a choppy shoreline. Given the cooler temperatures, dressing in layers is advisable; a light jacket paired with comfortable footwear should suffice for outdoor excursions. As we are well into late November, these temperatures are typical for this time of year in northern Illinois, embracing the season\u2019s characteristic chill. The conditions might limit outdoor activities, yet a scenic stroll along the beach or a cozy evening at a nearby caf\u00e9 would be fitting choices to enjoy the reflective mood of the evening.",
