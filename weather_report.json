    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the night is shrouded in clouds, with scattered showers and sporadic thunderstorms looming on the horizon. The overnight chill sits at around 64 degrees, subtly rising as the night deepens, while gusty winds whip from the south-southwest, gusting up to 45 miles per hour. The air is thick with the promise of rain, with a 70% chance that those showers will become a reality, likely bringing a quarter to half an inch of new precipitation\u2014an unwelcome reminder of nature\u2019s unpredictability this time of year. \n\nAs dawn approaches, the day will unfold with more storms likely, particularly before 1 pm. The high barely nudges to around 66 degrees, only to drop sharply into the afternoon as temperatures settle around 51. Those venturing outside should prepare for brisk conditions, complemented by a coat to shield against the wind and rain-soaked elements. The waves of Lake Michigan may be turbulent, reflecting the inclement weather, making for a robust view, but best observed from a distance. For those looking for refuge, curling up with a good book or visiting a local caf\u00e9 would provide solace from the tempestuous weather, especially as the day promises to be anything but serene.",
