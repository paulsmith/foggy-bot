    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston paint a chilly picture, with temperatures hovering in the mid 20s and a gentle breeze whispering from the northwest. The air carries a certain crispness, typical of a winter's night, as thick clouds blanket the sky. As night deepens, the shoreline of Lake Michigan looks serene yet somber, with muted waves lapping gently at the sandy beach.\n\nLooking ahead to Thursday, residents can expect a predominantly cloudy day with temperatures rising toward the mid 30s. A shift to a southerly breeze promises to bring with it the potential for snow later in the afternoon, with a 50% chance of precipitation that could leave a light dusting on the ground. Given the winter season, these temperatures align with what is typical for this time of year in the Midwest, lending an expectant feel to the atmosphere as the holiday season approaches. For those venturing out, layering up with warm clothing is advisable, as the air may feel even cooler with the expected wind. While bracing the elements, a stroll along the beach could be quite refreshing, but it's best to keep an eye on the forecast for those planning extended outdoor activities.",
