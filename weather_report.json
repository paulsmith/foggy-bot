    "weather_report": "This morning in Evanston, the air feels bitterly cold with temperatures hovering in the low single digits, accompanied by a formidable west wind that is whipping through the area. Currently, conditions are clear, but the chill is intensified by a hefty wind, creating an atmosphere that is not for the faint of heart. Looking ahead, the weather is expected to warm slightly throughout the day, reaching the mid-teens while maintaining mostly sunny skies, though wind chill could dip to dangerously low levels.\n\nAs night falls, expect clear skies and a low around mid-single digits, with an increase in temperatures overnight. No precipitation is on the horizon, making for a dry day and evening, but the angry, choppy waters of Lake Michigan could make for some turbulent waves, reflective of the blustery conditions. Given the frigid temperatures, layering is essential\u2014opt for insulated coats, hats, and gloves if venturing outside. The day, while typical for mid-December, demands caution, particularly for those unaccustomed to the bracing cold. It's ideal weather for a brisk walk along the beach to observe the surf or enjoy the serene beauty of winter's grip on the landscape, but be wary of the biting wind. Today is not a holiday, but the festive season is approaching, a reminder that warmth can come not only from the weather but also from community spirit.",
