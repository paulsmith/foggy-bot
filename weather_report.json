    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a chilly scene, with temperatures hovering in the mid-20s and a brisk breeze stirring around the beach. The sky is mostly clear, allowing a few scattered stars to twinkle overhead. Tonight promises to remain partly cloudy, dipping to the low 20s as the winds gently shift from the west-northwest. Tomorrow brings a touch of warmth, with highs expected to reach the low 30s, though that may feel cooler due to persistent gusts. \n\nWave conditions along Lake Michigan are likely to be moderate, influenced by the wind's current strength, creating a slightly choppy surface. While no precipitation is anticipated, the chill in the air suggests dressing warmly for outdoor ventures. Layering up with a sturdy coat, hat, and gloves will be key for comfort. Given the seasonal context, these temperatures align with early December norms, presenting an inviting opportunity to enjoy the brisk air along the shores, perhaps with a brisk walk or a contemplative moment by the lake.",
