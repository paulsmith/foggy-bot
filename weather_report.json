    "weather_report": "As the clock ticks past one in the morning in Evanston, the air carries a chill typical of early November, with temperatures hovering around 40 degrees. The sky wears a blanket of clouds, obscuring the stars, and a brisk west northwest wind dances through the area, gusting notably, which hints at an evolving weather pattern. By sunrise, the clouds will give way to a more promising day, with Friday promising clear blue skies and sunshine warming the shoreline, inviting a high near 52 by afternoon. \n\nThe beach, though quiet at this hour, swells with a palpable energy as the waves gently crash against the shore. While the water looks calm under the muted glow of the surrounding lights, the chill in the air suggests it is best to don a warm jacket, perhaps layered with a knit scarf and sturdy shoes, as nature's crispness mixed with gusty winds calls for thoughtful preparation. As the morning unfolds, locals may find joy in a simple walk along the beach, embracing the tranquility before bustling plans take shape later in the day. With no major holiday clouds looming over this Friday, it offers an ideal moment to relish the season's change amidst a fresh breeze and the gentle backdrop of Lake Michigan's soothing waves.",
