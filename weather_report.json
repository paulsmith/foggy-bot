    "weather_report": "As dusk settles over Evanston, a chill permeates the air with temperatures nestled in the low 30s, accompanied by a brisk westerly breeze that adds a biting edge to the evening. Currently, the scene is mostly cloudy, casting a dull hue over the landscape. Expect the afternoon to usher in some sunshine, albeit with temperatures only nudging up slightly before they begin to dip again. Tonight, the skies clear, bringing a refreshing crispness that signals the transition into a chilly night, with lows dipping into the low 20s.\n\nWave conditions along Lake Michigan may be moderate, stirred by the persistent winds; careful beachgoers and onlookers will notice the surf\u2019s spirited dance against the shoreline. While no precipitation currently threatens the area, the clear skies tonight should offer a pleasant sight for stargazers. To stay comfortable outdoors, dress warmly in layers with a cozy jacket, perhaps accompanied by a hat and gloves to fend off the cold. Considering it's late February, the current temperatures are somewhat typical for this season in the region, capturing the essence of winter's final weeks. As daylight stretches into evening, a stroll along the beach could prove invigorating, though an indoor retreat might be more inviting as the temperatures fall. Enjoy the calm before the impending spring reclaiming its ground in the days ahead.",
