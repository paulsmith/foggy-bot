    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the day awakens to a chill in the air, hovering in the upper 40s with a refreshing dampness that makes it feel even cooler. The atmosphere is dominated by clouds, lending an overcast appearance as the brisk southeast winds whip through at a gentle yet persistent pace, creating an invigorating feel at the beach. As we look to the day ahead, expect temperatures to climb slightly, peaking near the mid-50s, before gradually retreating to the lower 50s by afternoon. Although there is a slight chance for rain showers late tonight, the day remains predominantly dry.\n\nDespite the cloudy skies, the lake provides a serene backdrop, with gentle waves that might invite a quiet stroll along the shore. Dress warmly with a light jacket and perhaps a sweater underneath, as the conditions are best described as crisp and cool, typical for this time of year in the Midwest as autumn takes its hold. For those looking to embrace the outdoors, a visit to the beach may offer peace, though be aware of the wind if venturing away from the shoreline. The seasonal shift makes today\u2019s vibe distinctly autumnal, without any major holidays breaking the horizon just yet, leaving room for a contemplative day ahead.",
