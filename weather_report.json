    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently experiencing a rather chilly night, with temperatures hovering in the low 20s and a brisk wind adding a bite to the air. The skies are mostly cloudy, creating a somewhat somber atmosphere at the beach. Wave conditions along Lake Michigan may be a bit choppy due to the howling northwesterly winds, which are gusting quite fiercely. As we look ahead, overnight forecasts suggest occasional snow and scattered snow showers, but no significant accumulation is expected. The temperature will dip to around the mid-teens, with wind chills making it feel closer to the single digits.\n\nDuring the day on Thursday, we can anticipate a slight improvement as occasional morning flurries will give way to mostly sunny skies and a high near the upper 20s. However, the wind will remain nippy, so dressing warmly is essential; layering with a heavy coat, gloves, and a scarf would be appropriate to ward off the cold. While these wintery conditions might discourage long outdoor excursions, a brisk walk along the shoreline could be invigorating for those brave enough to embrace the season. As this chilly day unfolds, there are no notable holidays or events on the calendar, but a reminder of winter's presence lingers in the air.",
