    "weather_report": "Currently in Evanston, the air is crisp and cool at almost 49 degrees, accompanied by a gently blustery wind. As the night deepens, clouds blanket the sky, creating a somber atmosphere along the beach. Overnight, the temperature is expected to dip into the low 40s, with a slight uptick as the hours pass, but the chance of rain lingers nearby, particularly in the early morning hours.\n\nLooking ahead to Wednesday, the weather will remain unsettled with scattered rain showers likely before noon, fading into a partially sunny afternoon as temperatures slide back into the low 40s. Winds will increase, whipping from the west at a brisk pace, which may create choppy conditions on Lake Michigan. It's a day for layering\u2014consider a warm, waterproof jacket and sturdy shoes\u2014with the potential for light rain making outdoor activities less appealing. The season reflects typical November conditions in the region, where temperatures hover around the cooler end of the spectrum, reminding us that winter is drawing near. For those wishing to brave the elements, a stroll on the beach or visiting local coffee shops might offer a cozy respite from the chilly air.",
