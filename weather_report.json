    "weather_report": "The current weather in Evanston, Illinois, presents a crisp, cool atmosphere with temperatures lingering in the lower 20s and a noticeable breeze stirring from the west at nearly 50 miles per hour. The skies are mostly cloudy, casting a muted light over the scene while ongoing wind adds a wild edge. As we look ahead, intermittent snow showers are expected, particularly as we approach the afternoon, with a high peaking near the mid-20s and temperatures expected to slide back into the teens tonight. \n\nThe overall feel of the day is a blend of chilliness and blustery conditions, making outdoor venturing somewhat less than pleasant. Waves on Lake Michigan could be a bit unsettled, given the wind's strength, though no significant precipitation is imminent, with a low chance of light snowfall. For those braving the outdoors, a warm coat, sturdy boots, and perhaps a scarf would serve well; it\u2019s not quite the ideal winter day for lingering outside but could still be enjoyable for a brisk stroll along the shore or quick errand in the area. As today is neither a holiday nor the eve of one, the focus remains on finding warmth and comfort in a typical late November chill in the Midwest.",
