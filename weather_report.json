    "weather_report": "Currently in Evanston, the air feels cool and slightly damp, typical for a November night. With temperatures in the low 40s paired with moderate humidity, it creates a crisp atmosphere, especially as a gentle breeze whispers through from the southeast. As we look ahead, the overnight skies will cloud over, with temperatures dropping to around 43 degrees, setting the stage for a Saturday that will remain mostly cloudy. Expect a high near the low 50s, with winds shifting to a light and breezy feel throughout the day, possibly gusting up to 25 mph, adding a touch of chill to the air.\n\nWhile no precipitation is anticipated, early rowers and beach enthusiasts may find conditions less than inviting, especially with the obscured skies and the cool breeze. For those venturing outdoors, layering is recommended - think warm jackets complemented by hats and gloves to keep the chill at bay. As the season continues its descent into winter, the weather is considerably seasonal for this time of year, neither surprising nor harsh. Ideal activities would include cozy get-togethers in warm spaces or perhaps a brisk walk along the shoreline if the chill is manageable. As we move through the days, remember that the spirit of Thanksgiving is approaching, keeping the air ripe with anticipation.",
