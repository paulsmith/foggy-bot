    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly day, marked by a temperature in the low 30s and a blustery northwest wind stirring up the atmosphere. The clouds loom overhead, casting a gray pallor on the beach as intermittent snow showers are expected to sweep through later today. Looking ahead to Thanksgiving Day, residents can anticipate isolated snow showers after 4 PM, while the high will reach around 33 degrees with falling temperatures into the afternoon.\n\nThe wave conditions along Lake Michigan are likely to be moderate, creating a somewhat restless surface with waves that could offer a stark backdrop against the somber sky. As for precipitation, a light dusting from snow showers can be expected, making the landscape appear subdued yet beautiful in its winter attire. Given the brisk wind and cool temperatures, layering is advisable\u2014think warm coats, hats, and scarves to keep the chill at bay. Despite the weather, this time of year offers its own allure; the season is typical for late November in the Midwest, where crisp air and the beauty of nature's hibernation invite reflection and cozy indoor pursuits. While no major holidays coincide today, the upcoming festivities may inspire warm family gatherings, perhaps even in the comfort of home, away from the looming chill of the outdoors.",
