    "weather_report": "The current conditions in Evanston are quite chilly, with temperatures hovering in the low 20s, accompanied by a gentle breeze. The sky is clear, making for a tranquil night by the beach, where the sound of the gently lapping waves adds to the serene atmosphere. As we look ahead, the overnight forecast calls for partly cloudy skies, with temperatures dipping to around 16 degrees, and a light westward wind, setting the stage for a brisk night.\n\nCome Friday, residents can expect a bright and mostly sunny day, with temperatures rising into the low 30s. The wind will shift from the southwest, bringing gusty conditions that could add a bit of a chill, despite the sunshine. While the beach might look inviting under the clear skies, it's advisable to dress warmly, opting for layers and a sturdy coat to combat the biting cold. Overall, the upcoming days reflect a typical early December in the Midwest, with cool temperatures and a clear atmosphere, perfect for holidays yet to come. Outdoor activities could be best enjoyed during midday when the sun is out, although it's certainly wise to keep the cold in mind as you make plans.",
