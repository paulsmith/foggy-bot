    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reflect a cool evening, with temperatures in the low 40s and a predominantly clear sky, offering a tranquil yet crisp atmosphere. The whispering winds from the north-northeast add a refreshing chill, making it feel a touch cooler. As the night progresses, expect the clouds to gather, accompanied by a slight chance of rain showers late tonight. With a forecast low around 43, it\u2019s advisable to bundle up, especially with the forecast predicting consistent breezy conditions for the early hours.\n\nHeading into Tuesday, the day will dawn mostly sunny but still cool, with highs only reaching the upper 40s. This transitional fall weather is typical for November in the Midwest, as temperatures dip, giving way to a more crisp and brisk feel in the air. With wave conditions likely mild on Lake Michigan, it won\u2019t be a day for swimming, but a stroll along the shoreline could be invigorating. For those planning outings, dressing in layers is recommended, including a warm jacket and possibly a light scarf as chilly breezes may persist. As this evening does not coincide with any major holidays, it\u2019s an excellent opportunity to embrace the quiet beauty of the lake after dark.",
