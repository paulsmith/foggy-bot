    "weather_report": "A raw chill hangs in the air over Evanston this morning as temperatures hover in the low teens, accompanied by a brisk breeze that brings a biting edge to the otherwise mostly clear skies. As the day progresses, residents can expect a welcome warm-up, with sunny conditions promising to lift the high to a near-mid 20s by afternoon, even as a fierce northwesterly wind occasionally gusts, whipping across the lake and churning the waters into frothy waves. Tonight, the temperature will settle around the mid-teens under partly cloudy skies, maintaining that brisk feel as winds subside slightly but still dance at a gentle to moderate pace.\n\nThe scene at Lake Michigan is marked by lively wave conditions, a testament to yesterday's churning weather pattern. Without any precipitation in sight, the day\u2019s clear skies provide an inviting atmosphere, perfect for bundled-up outdoor activities. With proper attire\u2014think insulated jackets, hats, and gloves\u2014those seeking fresh air can enjoy brisk walks along the shoreline or revel in a scenic view of the expansive lake. Given the seasonal chill typically felt in December, these temperatures align fairly well with expectations for early winter in this region. Overall, today is one to experience the invigorating freshness of winter while savoring the beauty of the outdoors.",
