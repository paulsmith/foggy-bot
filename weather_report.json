    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois reveal a blustery scene with temperatures hovering in the mid 40s, underscored by a somewhat damp coolness that might put a chill in the air as daylight fades. The skies are heavily cloaked in clouds, contributing to a somber mood over Lake Michigan. Throughout the evening, expect more of the same, with temperatures dipping to the upper 30s, accompanied by a northwest wind, which will be noticeable but not overpowering, ranging from gentle to brisk with potential gusts stirring up the water.\n\nLooking ahead to Saturday, conditions will remain mostly cloudy, with daytime highs flirting with the mid 40s before settling back into the low 40s by the afternoon. Wave conditions at the beach may be vigorous due to the sustained wind, making the lake appear choppy and restless. While no precipitation is forecast, it\u2019s advisable to dress warmly and perhaps add a windbreaker to combat the gusty conditions. Being late November, these temperatures are typical for the season in this northern region, so a cozy day indoors or a brisk walk along the shore would be appropriate, particularly as we approach the Thanksgiving holiday.",
