    "weather_report": "This evening in Evanston, we find ourselves under a blanket of clouds with crisp, wintry conditions as the temperature settles into the mid-20s. A blustery wind is making its presence known, with gusts sweeping across the beach, enhancing the chill. As night falls, the atmosphere takes on a palpable stillness, punctuated only by the swaying of nearby structures. \n\nLooking ahead to the weather for tomorrow, a chance of snow looms as we approach the afternoon, likely beginning after 1 PM. The clouds are expected to linger, and temperatures will rise to the mid-30s, accompanied by a gentle breeze from the south-southeast. There's a 50% chance of precipitation, potentially resulting in light snow accumulation, making for a winter atmosphere that could delight those who enjoy the season's offerings. Despite the gusty wind tonight, the scene may transform into a serene snowy landscape by day's end. Given this chilly forecast, layers are advised\u2014think warm coats, hats, and mittens for those stepping outside. The temperature is par for the course for this time of year in the Midwest, typical of the winter season, where such crisp air and the prospect of snow can charm residents into embracing the outdoors. While outdoor excursions may be curtailed by the cold and wind, tomorrow evening could open up opportunities for cozy indoor activities, making it a fine chance to curl up with a good book or enjoy warm beverages, perfectly in tune with the holiday spirit just around the corner.",
