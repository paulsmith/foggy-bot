    "weather_report": "Currently in Evanston, temperatures linger in the low 40s, characterized by foggy conditions that envelop the area. A brisk, gentle breeze from the south adds a chill to the damp air, creating a slightly clammy atmosphere overall. As evening approaches, clouds are expected to gather more densely, with a possibility of light rainfall and continued fog into the night. Temperatures may rise slightly after dark, potentially reaching the mid 40s.\n\nGiven the conditions, the beach scene appears somewhat muted and gray, lacking the usual vibrancy of day with visibility hampered by mist. Wave conditions on Lake Michigan are likely to be moderate, influenced by the wind but not severe. For those venturing outside, layering is recommended, including a warm jacket and perhaps a scarf to combat the chill. As we are deep in December, this weather is quite typical for the season in this region, where cold and dampness are to be expected. Evening outdoor activities may be dampened by the uninviting weather, but cozying up indoors with warm drinks while enjoying a movie or visiting local shops could serve as pleasant alternatives during this foggy December evening.",
