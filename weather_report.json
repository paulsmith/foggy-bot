    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois, present a cool and slightly sticky atmosphere with a temperature hovering in the low 50s. The air is thick, contributing to a rather eerie ambiance characterized by patchy fog and mist, rendering visibility somewhat limited. As we move into the day, expect patchy fog to linger until mid-morning, giving way to rain showers by afternoon. The clouds will dominate the sky, and temperatures will only rise to the mid to upper 50s, accompanied by a gentle easterly breeze which may become brisker throughout the day.\n\nThe beach will have a somber look with gentle waves as lake conditions remain calm, perfect for a contemplative walk amidst the mist, although the rain could dampen outdoor plans. Given the cool temperatures and the moisture in the air, layering is advisable. A light jacket or windbreaker paired with comfortable shoes would be ideal for venturing outside. It's mid-November, so temperatures are in line with seasonal expectations, though approaching a muddy and wet evening might lead to more indoor activities. While not a designated holiday, the weather encourages moments of introspection rather than festive outings, making it a perfect time for cozy indoor endeavors or planning for the upcoming holidays.",
