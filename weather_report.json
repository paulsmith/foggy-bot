    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently experiencing a gloomy winter evening with temperatures in the low 40s, accompanied by swirling winds from the northwest that lend a brisk chill to the air. The atmosphere is thick with clouds, creating a somewhat dreary and subdued landscape. Tonight, there's a slight chance of rain before 7 PM, though the outlook suggests that intermittent drizzle may linger into the early morning, with patchy fog hazing visibility throughout the day. Expect highs struggling to reach the upper 30s tomorrow, under a mantle of cloud cover.\n\nWith the weather conditions being less than ideal, outdoor activities might be curtailed. Yet, if you venture out, dress warmly, including a sturdy coat, gloves, and perhaps a knitted hat to keep the cold at bay. Wave conditions along Lake Michigan could be somewhat restless due to the wind, lending a meeting of choppy waters against the shore, which may be best viewed from a distance. As we close out the year with December 29, Evanston reflects the chilly season characteristic of the Midwest, with current temperatures aligning with typical winter expectations.",
