    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently experiencing a rather chilly evening, with temperatures dipping into the low 50s and a notable overcast sky contributing to a gloomy atmosphere. The substantial humidity adds a touch of dampness to the air, making conditions feel slightly cooler than the thermometer might suggest. A gusty wind from the northwest is stirring up a bit of movement, creating a dynamic yet brisk coastal environment along Lake Michigan.\n\nLooking ahead to the forecast, a continued overcast is expected, with temperatures dropping further tonight to around the upper 40s. Winds will ease, but a gentle breeze will accompany the chilly ambiance into the early hours of Friday, which promises a similarly cloudy day with highs creeping up to the low 50s. It's advisable to don layers, including a warm jacket and perhaps a hat, as the air could feel nippy, especially along the shoreline. The cloudy conditions might limit visibility and make outdoor activity less inviting, yet a walk along the beach could still serve as a refreshing winter precursor. As the holiday season approaches, this chilly weather reflects the typical November vibe in the Midwest, just in time for the festivities ahead.",
