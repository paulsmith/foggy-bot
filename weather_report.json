    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the weather brings a distinctly chilly atmosphere this morning, with temperatures in the mid 30s making for a cool and damp day ahead. Light drizzle continues to fall, accompanied by swirling fog that blankets the lakeshore, contributing to a misty, atmospheric scene. As we look to the forecast, expect similar conditions to persist throughout the day, with overcast skies prevailing and temperatures nudging their way up to the low 40s by afternoon. A gentle breeze from the south will provide slight relief from the chill, although the dampness may make it feel chillier than it actually is.\n\nThe beach may not present ideal conditions for a leisurely stroll due to the ongoing precipitation and reduced visibility, but for those who don warm clothing, a brisk walk along the shore could still be invigorating. Swimmers and boaters should be mindful of the wave conditions, which could be moderate given the wind\u2019s strength, though the lake\u2019s surface will be tempered by the current drizzle. Layering is recommended\u2014think warm coats, hats, and perhaps waterproof footwear\u2014to brace against the cool moisture. Overall, despite the dreary weather, it captures the true essence of a winter morning by Lake Michigan, with the season\u2019s characteristic chill felt in every breath.",
