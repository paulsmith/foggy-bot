    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston paint a rather dreary picture, with temperatures hovering in the mid-30s accompanied by heavy mist and light rain. As you step outside, you\u2019ll feel the chill amplified by fierce winds swirling in from the northwest; it\u2019s a day to brace yourself against the elements. Visibility is limited, and the skies above are predominantly gray, enveloping the area in an overcast gloom. \n\nLooking ahead to later today, the forecast doesn't offer much relief, predicting cloudy skies with a slight chance of ongoing rain, particularly before midnight. As temperatures rise only slightly to the low 40s, the gusty winds may lead to a wild and blustery experience, perfect for staying snug indoors. For those who must venture out, layered attire is a must\u2014think warm jackets, sturdy footwear, and perhaps a raincoat to fend off the damp chill. Given the current season, these temperatures are typical for late November in the Midwest, as the landscape prepares for winter\u2019s embrace. As for activities, the weather isn\u2019t inviting for leisurely strolls along the lake, but it could be a great opportunity to explore cozy indoor spots or enjoy hot beverages at local caf\u00e9s.",
