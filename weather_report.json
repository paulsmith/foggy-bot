    "weather_report": "As evening settles over Evanston, current conditions present a cold, crisp atmosphere with temperatures in the low 20s and a gentle cloud cover above. The air feels decidedly brisk with a moisture-laden chill, making it a stark reminder of winter's firm grip on the region. Looking ahead, tonight's forecast anticipates the possibility of light snow showers as temperatures dip to around the mid-20s, complemented by a northeast breeze that adds a touch of bite. A mere 20% chance of precipitation indicates that any accumulation will be minimal, likely just enough to coat the ground in a fleeting white dusting.\n\nOn Wednesday, the skies will remain predominantly cloudy with a higher chance of snow in the morning hours, setting the scene for a chilly day as temperatures creep up to the low 30s before retreating slightly by afternoon. Given these frigid temperatures and the looming cloud cover, anyone venturing outside should dress warmly in layers, perhaps donning a cozy hat and gloves for comfort against the cold. Wave conditions along the lakeshore are likely moderate, with an unsettled demeanor mirrored in the sky above. As February unfolds, such wintry weather is typical for the region; it\u2019s a time to embrace indoor activities, perhaps cozying up with a good book or enjoying a warm beverage as the world outside transforms under a veil of clouds.",
