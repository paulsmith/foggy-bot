    "weather_report": "As we step into the early hours of December 6th in Evanston, the air is crisp and biting, perfect for the season. The temperature hovers in the low 20s, complemented by a refreshing breeze that dances around 17 miles per hour from the west. With clear skies overhead, starlight glimmers on the surface of Lake Michigan, offering a serene backdrop to the chilly night. There are no signs of precipitation to disrupt the stillness, allowing for a tranquil experience outside. \n\nAs we look ahead to the day, expect a gradual warming, with daytime temperatures climbing into the low 30s, making the afternoon feel like a lovely winter's day. The sun will shine brightly, though the day may feel blustery at times, especially with gusts reaching up to 25 miles per hour. Given the potential for wind and cooler air, appropriate layering is advisable. A warm coat, gloves, and a snug hat are essential for comfort. With these brisk winter conditions, it\u2019s an ideal time for outdoor activities such as a brisk walk along the lakefront or an afternoon exploring the parks, all while enjoying the beauty of Evanston in the winter season.",
