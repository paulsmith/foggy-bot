    "weather_report": "Evanston finds itself under a chilly blanket today, with temperatures hovering in the low 20s. Outside, the air has a biting crispness, where every gust from the west brings a hint of ferocity, stirring up the light snow that intermittently falls. The snow adds an ethereal softness to the otherwise stark landscape but does little to warm the scene; with a wind chill that plunges temperatures further, the day is decidedly blustery, knitting a fabric of discomfort for any unprepared souls venturing outside.\n\nAs the afternoon unfolds, expect more fleeting snow showers amid overcast skies, with highs only managing to climb into the mid-20s. Tonight, temperatures dip even further, flirting with the edge of single digits, making it essential to bundle up if you find yourself outdoors. The lake, rippling gently under the gray sky, presents moderate wave conditions, but swimming is best left for warmer days. Attire should reflect the severity of the cold: heavy coats, scarves, and warm boots are a must. In this late November moment, we are squarely deep within the grips of winter. While the beach may still lure some for brisk walks or winter photo ops, it\u2019s best suited for cozy indoor activities like sipping hot drinks by the fire, perhaps reflecting on the changing seasons as we approach the festive holiday season.",
