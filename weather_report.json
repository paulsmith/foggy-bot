    "weather_report": "Currently in Evanston, the temperature rests in the upper 40s, complimented by a persistent drizzle that adds a somber note to the evening atmosphere. The air carries a chill, intensified by a brisk wind from the southwest, creating a damp and slightly uncomfortable sensation for those outdoors. As night deepens, the clouds will linger, but a slight chance of rain will taper off before dawn, allowing temperatures to hover around the mid 40s.\n\nLooking ahead to Monday, the day promises a transition to partly sunny conditions, with temperatures peaking near the low 50s. A gentle breeze will transform into a more noticeable flow, perfect for a refreshing stroll, albeit under the watchful gaze of a cooler sky. The waves on Lake Michigan may pick up a bit, making it a suitable backdrop for a contemplative moment by the shore. With the current season firmly in the grips of winter, these temperatures remain true to character for this time of year. While outdoor adventures may be limited, a cozy caf\u00e9 visit or a brisk walk through town could be quite enjoyable, especially as the forecast hints at brighter moments ahead.",
