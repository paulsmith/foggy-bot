    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a brisk and unsettled atmosphere, with temperatures hovering in the upper 40s. The air carries a comforting chill, characteristic of December, as heavy clouds blanket the sky. With gusty winds pushing through at about 33 miles per hour, outdoor activity requires a layer to ward off the cool breeze. As we look ahead, expect a transition to partly sunny skies this afternoon, peaking near the low 50s, before temperatures dip later to a low in the low 30s by nightfall.\n\nDespite the veil of clouds, the day has a fresh undertone that could be deemed invigorating for outdoor enthusiasts. However, the wave conditions on Lake Michigan may feel lively with the wind, inviting those who are prepared for such a bracing encounter. Precipitation is not on the horizon, allowing for dry conditions throughout the day. Ideal attire for enjoying this weather would involve a warm coat and possibly a scarf, making a brisk walk along the beach a delightful option amidst the seasonal beauty. Given that it\u2019s December, temperatures are, as expected, markedly lower than the preceding months, fitting comfortably into the winter narrative of the Great Lakes region.",
