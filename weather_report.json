    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the current weather presents a brisk and wintry scene, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s and a notable, howling wind that adds a biting chill to the air. Although the sky is partly cloudy, the cold penetrates through a humidity level that keeps the atmosphere feeling quite damp and chilly. As the day progresses, scattered rain and snow showers are expected, swirling in after 3 PM, while a high near the upper 30s will only provide a brief respite before temperatures begin to dip again in the afternoon.\n\nThis evening, the forecast predicts scattered snow showers before 10 PM, transitioning into a mostly cloudy night with lows around 14. Wind chill could plunge to an uncomfortable -4 degrees, underlining the need for warm and wind-resistant clothing. The lake's surface might show some wave activity as gusts reach up to 50 mph, making conditions less than inviting for outdoor pursuits. For those venturing out, layering up with hats, gloves, and heavier coats is essential to combat the formidable chill. Given that we are in early December, these temperatures feel about typical for this time of year, embracing a true northern winter atmosphere. As we brace for the festive season, indoors may be where most will want to be, enjoying warm drinks while snowflakes dance outside.",
