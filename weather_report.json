    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the current weather paints a chilly scene with temperatures hovering in the mid-20s, combined with a brisk, gusty wind sweeping in from the southwest. Under mostly cloudy skies, the atmosphere feels crisp yet biting, urging one to bundle up against the freshness that permeates the air. As the day unfolds, expect a transition to partly sunny skies, with highs reaching into the low 40s and winds maintaining their spirited nature, gusting up to 35 mph, which will keep the wind chill noticeably lower. Tonight, temperatures will drop to the mid-30s as clouds linger, creating a cool evening.\n\nThe waves along Lake Michigan may be slightly choppy due to the wind, but there\u2019s no precipitation expected today, allowing for clarity in the surroundings despite the chilly air. Recommended attire would include warmer layers, perhaps a good winter coat, a hat, and gloves to fend off the bite of the cold. Given that we're deep into December, these temperatures are typical for this time of year in the Midwest, where winter's grip often brings such brisk conditions. Ideal outdoor activities may include a brisk walk along the shoreline, enjoying the scenic views of the lake, or perhaps a cozy afternoon at a nearby caf\u00e9, appreciating the charm of Evanston as the holiday season approaches.",
