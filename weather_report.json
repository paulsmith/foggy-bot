    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current scene is marked by a chilly atmosphere with temperatures hovering in the low 30s, accompanied by a blustery wind that adds a bite to the air. The sky is cloaked in clouds, casting a gray hue over the landscape as night settles in. This evening calls for a chance of snow showers before midnight, with temperatures dipping to the upper 20s. Tomorrow, residents can expect continued chances of snow in the morning, as colder air filters in, pushing highs to just around the low 30s by afternoon. The shifting winds will be brisk, particularly in the later hours, creating a setting that may feel invigorating but also brisk and wintry.\n\nGiven the conditions, it's advisable to bundle up, opting for warm layers, perhaps a wool hat and gloves, to stave off the chill. The evening's blustery conditions may stir up small waves on Lake Michigan, likely making for an impressive sight along the shore, but perhaps not ideal for boating or leisurely strolls by the water. As we inch closer to the holiday season, with festive gatherings looming on the horizon, it\u2019s a perfect time to enjoy indoor activities or cozy up with loved ones by the fire, rather than venturing outdoors in this frosty milieu.",
