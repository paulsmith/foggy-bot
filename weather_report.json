    "weather_report": "In Evanston this evening, the atmosphere is decidedly chilly, with a brisk wind whispering off the coast, creating a rather stark yet serene setting. Currently, temperatures linger in the low 40s, accompanied by overcast skies, as the air feels quite cool against the skin. The view toward Lake Michigan reveals a muted landscape; the beach is nearly deserted in the dim light, with the undulating waves reflecting the day\u2019s somber mood.\n\nAs the night progresses, the forecast anticipates a shift to partly cloudy skies, with temperatures dipping to around the upper 20s. Tomorrow promises a sunnier disposition; however, don\u2019t expect the warmth to return, as highs will only reach the low 40s, dropping throughout the afternoon. For those venturing outside, it\u2019s best to dress warmly in layers, with a sturdy jacket to fend off the cold and wind, which may gust at times, making it feel even colder. Situated in late November, these conditions align closely with the norms of the season\u2014typical for this time of year in the Midwest. The waves may churn with a noticeable vigor due to the gusty winds, presenting a rougher shoreline that\u2019s best appreciated from a distance rather than a swimming venture. If you\u2019re contemplating activities, perhaps a brisk walk to enjoy the stark beauty of a Northern Illinois winter, or simply a cozy evening indoors, would be best suited for the current ambiance.",
