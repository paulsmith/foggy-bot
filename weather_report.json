    "weather_report": "This evening in Evanston, the air feels crisp and cool as temperatures hover in the mid 30s, complemented by a blustery wind making for a biting chill. The sky remains cloudy, lending a muted appearance to the surrounding landscape. Tonight's forecast shows partly cloudy skies with temperatures dipping to the low 30s, while winds from the west-northwest are expected to maintain their gusty nature, reaching up to 30 mph.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, residents can anticipate sunny skies and a high near 40, though temperatures will gradually fall by the afternoon. The wind will continue to whistle and dance at around 10 to 15 mph, contributing to an invigorating feel as late fall settles deeper into the region. Given the current chilly conditions and the absence of precipitation, outdoor activities may be best enjoyed with warm attire, such as thick jackets and gloves, to fully embrace the wintry atmosphere without discomfort. These conditions are typical for this time of year in the Midwest, inviting a reminder of the beauty and briskness that autumn brings as it transitions into winter.",
