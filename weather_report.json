    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reflect a chilly ambiance marked by lingering fog and mist, with temperatures in the low 40s. As dawn approaches, the area is draped in a thick shroud of moisture, making the already cool air feel even crisper. This morning's fog is expected to dissipate, though cloud cover will persist throughout the day. The day will see a high nearing 50 degrees, cooling somewhat by the afternoon under a gentle breeze shifting from the southwest to the west, bringing with it occasional gusts.\n\nExpect wave conditions on Lake Michigan to be moderately choppy, a reflection of the breezy wind dynamics. Fortunately, the forecast indicates no significant precipitation, allowing for a slightly clearer afternoon as the day progresses. However, dressed warmly, consider donning layers, suitable for a stroll along the shoreline or enjoying a coffee at a local cafe. It's a typical winter day in the region, with conditions that might inspire few outdoor exertions aside from a brisk walk or a visit to a nearby art exhibition. Though February does not herald a holiday today, it does carry the promise of spring just around the corner.",
