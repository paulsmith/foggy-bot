    "weather_report": "In Evanston, this morning presents a brisk start with temperatures hovering in the mid 40s, bringing a refreshing coolness to the air, paired with a thick blanket of clouds that casts a grayish hue over the landscape. With the wind howling from the west-southwest at 41 miles per hour, the conditions feel particularly brisk, pushing the chill closer to the skin. The beach view offers a dramatic scene, one that feels both wild and invigorating, but the prominent cloud cover does little to invite outdoor relaxation.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect partial sunshine to break through the clouds, but temperatures will only reach up to near 50, before settling back down to the low 30s tonight. With a forecast of mostly cloudy skies in the evening and a rising temperature overnight, the air will likely remain crisp. Wave conditions may be somewhat aggressive due to the strong winds, making it less than ideal for beach outings, while boaters should exercise caution given the gale-like breezes. There\u2019s no precipitation on the horizon, allowing for dry conditions throughout the day.\n\nFor those venturing out, warm layers are essential to combat the cool temperatures, complemented by a wind-resistant jacket against the fierce gusts. While not officially a holiday, it\u2019s a peaceful Saturday that invites the possibility of indoor activities, such as visiting a local caf\u00e9 or exploring nearby shops. With the winter season approaching and temperatures in the expected range for this time of year, it's a reminder of the invigorating chill that characterizes this part of the year in the Midwest.",
