    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Evanston, the air is crisp and cool, enveloping the area with a blanket of cloud cover. Current conditions reveal a temperature in the low 40s paired with noticeable winds that add a chill to the overall atmosphere. The brisk conditions, alongside the rich, moist air quality, create a somewhat dreary scene, leaving the beach looking subdued, yet tranquil. Wave activity is moderate, reflecting the sky\u2019s temperamental demeanor, though no precipitation is currently expected. \n\nThe forecast for today anticipates mostly cloudy skies with a high reaching near 44, slightly dipping into the 40s as the day progresses. A gentle west wind will provide some relief but may still feel biting to those exposed to it. Attire should include layers with a warm outer shell\u2014perhaps a light jacket\u2014to ensure comfort while venturing outside. As we approach Thanksgiving, these seasonal conditions are typical for late November in the Midwest, inviting a spirit of reflection as families gather for the holiday.\n\nFor those seeking activities, this weather may discourage long outdoor ventures; however, it presents a perfect backdrop for a cozy caf\u00e9 outing or a leisurely stroll along the beach, taking in the serene beauty of Lake Michigan under the muted skies.",
