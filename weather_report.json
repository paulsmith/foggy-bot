    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chill in the air, as temperatures hover in the low 40s, accompanied by a persistent drizzle and low visibility from fog. The atmosphere feels damp and raw, with a gentle breeze stirring through the area, making it an uninviting night. As we look ahead, tonight is set to bring likely rainfall and areas of fog, leading into a cloudy morning. The forecast indicates temperatures will dip slightly to around the mid to upper 30s, and the winds will shift to a softer breeze from the southeast.\n\nThe outlook for tomorrow is not much brighter; expect continuing rainfall and patchy fog, with the potential for isolated thunderstorms early on. The high will reach only the upper 30s, quickly giving way to temperatures that could fall into the mid-30s by the afternoon, with gusty winds creating chilly conditions. Such weather lends itself to cozy indoor activities, perhaps a warm cup of coffee at a local caf\u00e9 or indulging in a relaxing afternoon with a good book. Overall, it\u2019s a stark winter's night in Evanston, not quite typical of more hospitable February days, but certainly part of the seasonal embrace as we navigate the depths of winter.",
