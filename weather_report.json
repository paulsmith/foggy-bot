    "weather_report": "As the early hours of the morning settle over Evanston, the air carries a chill, with temperatures hovering in the mid 30s and a blustery wind sweeping in from the northwest, creating a brisk atmosphere along the lakefront. The scene this evening features mostly cloudy skies, setting a muted backdrop that reflects the sharpness of the cool air. With no precipitation expected overnight and a low creeping down to the high 20s, it feels distinctly wintery, common for this time of year in the Midwest.\n\nLooking ahead to Tuesday, the forecast reveals a promising sunny day, with temperatures rising to near 40 before gradually retreating. Winds will ease, but that familiar, refreshing bite will remain, ideal for bundling up in warm layers. The waves lapping the shore may be slightly choppy due to the residual gusts tonight, though they shouldn't pose any significant hazards. As we embrace these characteristic seasonal changes of late November, residents might consider engaging in light outdoor activities, such as a brisk walk along the lake or a visit to the nearby parks, ensuring they dress warmly to enjoy the crisp beauty of a winter's day in Evanston.",
