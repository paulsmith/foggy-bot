    "weather_report": "This evening in Evanston, the weather feels decidedly cool and damp, with a brisk breeze making the temperature feel a bit chillier. Currently, the air is noticeably cooler, sitting in the low 50s, and while mostly clear, the clouds are beginning to blanket the sky as the night deepens. The wind is howling from the southwest, creating a blustery atmosphere that may dissuade late-night strolls along the beach.\n\nAs we look toward the overnight hours, expect a slight chance of rain mixed with drizzle, primarily between midnight and dawn. The temperature is projected to dip to the mid-40s, with winds maintaining their strength, gusting upward of 25 miles per hour. Following this cool front, Monday is anticipated to bring partly sunny skies, though temperatures will only reach the low 50s before slipping back into the upper 40s by afternoon. \n\nWith conditions leaning toward the damp and breezy, a light jacket is advisable for outdoor endeavors, particularly those near the waterfront where the winds can feel more intense. Given this wintry season, these temperatures are somewhat typical for early December in the Midwest, marking the transition into the heart of winter. A cozy indoor activity like visiting a local caf\u00e9 or enjoying a warm beverage would be perfect, allowing residents to savor the rich, seasonal aromas while sheltering from the night's chill.",
