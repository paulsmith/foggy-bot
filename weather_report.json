    "weather_report": "The current weather in Evanston, Illinois, is notably frigid, with temperatures hovering in the low teens. The conditions are clear, offering a pristine view of the night sky as the north-northwest wind whips fiercely, creating a biting chill that may leave those venturing outdoors feeling the sharpness of winter. The beach, typically bustling in warmer months, lies dormant under the cold, with no rain or snow expected to dampen the evening. Tomorrow promises a brief respite from the bitter cold, with partly sunny skies and temperatures rising to the high 20s; however, the wind will continue to maintain a brisk atmosphere, reminding residents that winter is firmly upon them.\n\nGiven the severe cold, bundled layers will be essential for anyone heading outside, particularly during the overnight period when wind chill could dip dangerously low. Although the conditions are decidedly wintery, adventurous spirits might enjoy a brisk walk along the beach, where the rugged beauty of Lake Michigan can be appreciated, albeit in a very different light than summer's warmth. Today might not be earmarked as a celebratory occasion, but as we move into the holiday season, the festive air will soon emerge.",
