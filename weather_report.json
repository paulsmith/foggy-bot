    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently experiencing a chilly evening with a temperature hovering in the low 40s, complemented by a high level of moisture in the air that makes it feel slightly damp and brisk. The wind is notably gusty, whipping around at speeds that can catch you off guard, contributing to an overall sense of briskness as you navigate the cloudy surroundings. Tonight, expect patchy fog rolling in after 11 PM, which may obscure the view of the serene Lake Michigan for a period, paired with a low near the mid 30s. \n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, one can anticipate a slightly improving scene; mornings will see areas of fog and a light drizzle before giving way to partly sunny skies and a high reaching the low 50s. Although the weather brings clouds and potential drizzle, it aligns with typical late November conditions in this region, where coolness prevails but often invites a splash of sunlight. As the wave conditions on the lake will be relatively calm due to the gentle winds expected tomorrow, this may be a good time for a walk along the shore. However, layering up is highly advisable to combat the chill, especially if you're venturing outdoors in the early hours. While it\u2019s not a holiday today, those with plans for the upcoming Thanksgiving weekend may begin their preparations in the comfort of their homes, perhaps even under a cozy blanket as they enjoy the evolving weather.",
