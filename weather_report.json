    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current scene is marked by a heavy drizzle and an enveloping fog that creates an atmosphere of stillness, punctuated occasionally by the sound of gusty winds barreling in from the south. The temperature hovers in the low 60s, lending a damp chill to the air, while humidity feels stifling, contributing to the discomfort of being outside. As night approaches, conditions are set to worsen with a forecast of showers and thunderstorms expected to roll in, bringing the possibility of significant rainfall, with totals potentially reaching up to 2 inches. Gale-force gusts will accompany these storms, making the evening particularly blustery.\n\nAs we look toward tomorrow, expect a continuation of this unsettled weather. The day will remain cloudy with temperatures fluctuating around the mid-60s, and further precipitation is likely throughout the day. Given the uninviting conditions, which are not typical for early November, dressing in waterproof layers and sturdy footwear is advisable. With outdoor activities winding down in light of the stormy forecast, it may be best to seek refuge indoors, catching up on reading or enjoying a warm beverage. Although this evening marks no holiday, it serves as a reminder of the changing seasons and the onset of more turbulent weather ahead.",
