    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the air is currently brisk, with temperatures in the low 30s and a shivering breeze coming from the south at a fierce clip. The cloudy skies cast a dim veil over the day, contributing to a chilly ambiance as the wind whips through, adding a biting edge. The forecast for the night hints at a slight chance of freezing drizzle and other forms of light precipitation, culminating in a low near 30. Notably, as the hours grow later, temperatures are expected to stabilize around 32, leaving the evening to feel particularly cool and damp.\n\nLooking forward to Monday, conditions may bring more of the same, with a chance of precipitation in the form of freezing drizzle before noon, then transitioning to drizzle and potentially rain later in the day. Highs could rise to nearly 40, but the presence of a steady breeze will persist, keeping the outdoor experience less than inviting. Wave conditions along the shore are expected to be noticeable, with choppy waters reflecting the gusty winds; local beach enthusiasts should take caution. Because of the chilly, damp feel, it\u2019s advisable to dress warmly\u2014layers of thick clothing along with waterproof outerwear would be sensible. Given that we are in the heart of December, these temperatures are quite typical for the season. There might be a temptation to head outdoors for some winter activities, but considering the weather, indoor pursuits seem more appropriate as we approach the holiday season.",
