    "weather_report": "In Evanston today, the weather presents a notably chilly scene, with temperatures hovering in the lower 40s and a steady, gusty northwesterly wind that adds a biting edge to the day. Cloud cover blankets the sky, casting a dreary gray over the landscape, while conditions remain dry without any sign of precipitation. As the afternoon unfolds, temperatures are expected to dip slightly, creating a cool and crisp environment that may deter outdoor enthusiasts. However, the ocean\u2019s waves show a gentle swell, with the breeze likely picking up just enough to invigorate a stroll along the beach, though it might not feel too inviting given the chill in the air.\n\nConsidering the season, these conditions are typical for late November in the Midwest, where the transition to winter settles in, best suited for layers of warm clothing. A cozy jacket, hat, and perhaps even gloves would be wise attire for anyone venturing outside. While the robust gusts may be refreshing, they could also lead to a rather brisk experience along the shore. With Thanksgiving right around the corner, families may still find time for short outdoor activities, such as a brisk walk or quick jog along the lakeside, though those who prefer to stay warm indoors will find plenty to celebrate leading up to the holiday.",
