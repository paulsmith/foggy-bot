    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois, reveal a brisk and somewhat blustery day along Lake Michigan. The temperature hovers in the mid 40s, complemented by a moderate level of humidity, creating a cool and refreshing atmosphere typical for this time of year. Visibility is somewhat diminished, with a solid layer of clouds dominating the sky and a prevailing southeast wind that adds a chill to the air, gusting at times fiercely. As we look ahead, rain is anticipated after 5 PM, with a high expected near the low 50s, leading to an increased chance of precipitation as night approaches, reaching a certainty of 100%.\n\nGiven the chilly and damp forecast, it would be wise to dress warmly\u2014layers are essential, with a waterproof jacket recommended to fend off the impending rain. Wave conditions along the beach may be somewhat turbulent, a product of the gusty winds, making it less than ideal for recreational activities. While the beach might not be inviting for sunbathing or swimming, the afternoon is better suited for cozy indoor pursuits or perhaps a brisk walk to enjoy the fresh, invigorating air before the rain arrives. There are no significant holidays today in the U.S. calendar, but the changing weather serves as a reminder that fall is firmly upon us.",
