    "weather_report": "As of now, Evanston is experiencing chilly conditions, with temperatures just above freezing and a notable breeze creating an invigorating atmosphere. The air is crisp yet somewhat moist, adding a slight edge to the coolness of the night. Looking ahead, the forecast suggests a transition to mostly sunny skies on Thursday, with a high reaching the mid-50s as the day unfolds, providing a contrast to the current chill. However, be prepared for a chance of light rain showers in the late afternoon, with a mere 20% likelihood of precipitation.\n\nThe wave conditions along Lake Michigan might be moderate given the winds from the southwest, so while not ideal for swimming or water sports, the beach could still offer a refreshing walk. With the forecast suggesting a gradual warming trend into the day, layered attire is recommended, allowing for comfort as morning chills give way to the slightly warmer afternoon temperatures. Given that it's early February and in northern Illinois, these temperatures are par for the course this time of year, characteristic of a typical winter season. Activities such as visiting local caf\u00e9s or indulging in a cozy book by the window could be delightful ways to embrace the day's offering while keeping cozy inside.",
