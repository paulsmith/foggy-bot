    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently enveloped in a chilly and damp atmosphere, with light snow and mist adorning the landscapes. The temperature hovers around the low 30s, giving off a crisp, wintry feel that is typical for this time of year in the Midwest. As we look ahead to today, a snowy and cloudy day is expected with temperatures peaking near the mid-30s before settling into the low 30s by afternoon. Blustery north winds at 20 to 25 mph with gusts could reach 40 mph, adding a biting chill to the air, making outdoor conditions less than inviting.\n\nAs the waves lap against the shore of Lake Michigan, one can expect them to be moderately rough due to the brisk wind, which could pose challenges for anyone considering water activities. There is a significant chance of snow accumulation, so travelers and pedestrians should be cautious as they navigate potentially slick surfaces. For those braving the cold, wearing layered, insulated attire with a good coat, hat, and gloves is highly recommended. While today might not be ideal for outdoor excursions, it lends itself well to cozying up indoors, perhaps enjoying a warm drink or indulging in holiday preparations as the season approaches. Remember, today is not a holiday, but the feel of the season is unmistakable.",
