    "weather_report": "The current weather in Evanston, Illinois, presents a chilly atmosphere with temperatures in the low 40s, accompanied by a brisk, blustery wind that makes the air feel even cooler. The sky is clear this morning, providing a vibrant contrast to the stillness of Lake Michigan, though the wind is creating waves that could catch the eye of any local beachgoer. As we move through the day, expect sunny conditions, with high temperatures inching close to the upper 40s but dipping back to around 42 by afternoon. \n\nLooking ahead, tonight will usher in scattered rain showers after midnight, shrouding the region in mostly cloudy skies. Temperatures will drop to the mid-30s, with slight chances of rising overnight. Given these conditions, it\u2019s advisable to wear layers, opting for a warm jacket and perhaps a waterproof outer layer if you plan to be out later. As for outdoor activities, the clear morning gives way to a chilly day, which might be ideal for a quick walk along the beach, but prepare for rain if you're out after dark. With the late February chill still holding sway, this weather is typical for the season in this region, reminding us that winter is still in its closing act.",
