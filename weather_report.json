    "weather_report": "This morning, Evanston wakes to a rather damp and overcast scene, with the temperature resting comfortably in the mid-60s, creating a humid atmosphere that feels thick in the air. The breeze off Lake Michigan is strong and gusty, kicking up the waves and adding to the cool, damp sensation. Currently, rain falls steadily, a persistent mist overlaying the early day, obscuring distant views. The weather is not particularly inviting, a somber gray casting a muted light over the landscape.\n\nAs the day progresses, expect continued showers, possibly accompanied by thunderstorm activity. The forecasts indicate a high nearing the upper 60s, with temperatures likely dropping in the afternoon, along with a heightened chance of significant rainfall that could range from one to two inches. The wave conditions may become more tumultuous as the winds maintain their fierce temperament, making the lake quite choppy. For outfits, consider waterproof clothing\u2014perhaps a rain jacket and sturdy shoes\u2014ideal for navigating through the slick streets and potentially wet environments. Given that this is early November, the current temperatures align with seasonal expectations, though the rain and humidity make it feel cooler than it reads. Outdoor activities might be curtailed, but cozying up with a warm drink indoors could be a delightful alternative on this dreary day.",
