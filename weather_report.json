    "weather_report": "Evanston currently bathed in a chill around the low 40s, stands under a dense curtain of clouds. The atmosphere feels damp, making it a rather brisk night along the shoreline, where gusty winds swirl in from the north, adding to the briskness of the evening. While isolated rain showers may have lingered just a while ago, conditions are set to shift, promising mostly sunny skies for Tuesday with temperatures climbing to a high near the upper 40s. The distinct chill is expected to hold sway throughout the night, though, as temperatures gradually creep upward to around 46 degrees.\n\nTomorrow greets us with a clearer outlook, a stark contrast to the cloud-covered canvas of the current evening. Given the wind's bluster and the damp feel of the air, those venturing outside should bundle up in warm attire, including jackets and perhaps a hat to shield against the blustery breeze. As for activities, the improving weather suggests a lovely opportunity for a walk along the beach or perhaps a stroll through local parks, taking in the refreshing autumn air. While we remain in the grip of fall, these temperatures are consistent with the seasonal expectations for this part of the Midwest, reminding us that winter is just around the corner.",
