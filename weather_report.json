    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a chilly and dreary picture, with temperatures hovering in the low 50s and humidity lending a dampness to the air. The blustery winds out of the northwest, reaching up to 40 miles per hour, add a biting edge to the atmosphere, making it feel even cooler. While the day is marked by an unrelenting cloud cover, with no precipitation currently falling, the ambiance retains a somewhat foreboding vibe as clouds dominate the skyline. \n\nAs the afternoon progresses, we can expect temperatures to peak around the mid-50s before gradually lowering again. Tonight, a similarly cloudy night will settle in, with temperatures dipping to the upper 40s and winds calming slightly but still maintaining a gentle presence. Given the brisk conditions and overcast sky, it\u2019s advisable to wear layers\u2014a warm jacket is a must, complemented by a hat to fend off the chill. These conditions are typical for this time of year in the Midwest, where November ushers in cooler weather as we approach the winter season. For those contemplating outdoor activities, the beach may be best appreciated through a brisk walk, but the water looks too chilly to tempt most into a swim. It\u2019s important to note that today is a regular weekday, with no major holidays or events on the horizon in the immediate future.",
