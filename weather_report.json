    "weather_report": "The current weather in Evanston, Illinois, reflects a rather gloomy early morning, with the temperature resting in the low 40s and light rain falling intermittently. A sense of coolness lingers in the air, accentuated by the dampness, evoking a brisk and somewhat chill vibe for those who step outdoors. As the day unfolds, scattered showers and thunderstorms are expected overnight, with temperatures dropping to around the mid 30s. A light breeze from the west southwest may provide a touch of refreshment but will also contribute to a notably cool atmosphere.\n\nLooking ahead to Tuesday, residents can anticipate a shift toward brighter conditions, with mostly sunny skies predominating. Highs are projected to flirt with the mid 40s, before decreasing to the low 40s by afternoon. This change could foster a more pleasant environment, though the presence of gusty north northwest winds may add a brisk edge to the day. The lake may exhibit moderate wave conditions, possibly making it a less than favorable day for leisurely waterfront activities except for those who enjoy a brisk walk along the shore wrapped in a cozy jacket. \n\nGiven the season, these temperatures align with winter expectations in the Midwest, emphasizing the cool nature of February. For those venturing outside, dressing in layers will be wise, including a warm, waterproof coat, as the possibility of further rain persists. While today isn't marked by any notable holiday or festivity, it's a quiet reminder of the winter season, leading into spring.",
