    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly atmosphere, with temperatures lingering in the low 40s and a high level of humidity creating a damp, almost somber feel to the night. The wind is brisk, originating from the south, adding a gentle bite to the air as it sweeps across the beach, generating a sense of restlessness on the otherwise tranquil Lake Michigan. The view is obscured under a blanket of clouds, suggesting a rather bleak, overcast night. \n\nLooking ahead to Saturday, expect continued cloud cover with temperatures rising to the low 50s before settling back into the upper 40s by afternoon. Wind speeds will pick up slightly, bringing gusts that could invigorate the scene, but overall, it promises to be another cloudy day with no immediate threat of precipitation. Given the season, these temperatures are typical for mid-November in this region, reflecting the gradual transition into the colder months. In such weather, layering is advisable; a warm jacket, perhaps a light scarf, will keep you comfortable while being outdoors. While beach outings may not be appealing, a stroll along the lakeshore or a visit to local cafes to enjoy a warm drink could be a fulfilling way to embrace the cool, cloudy day ahead.",
