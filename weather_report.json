    "weather_report": "As the clock approaches the early hours of December 17th in Evanston, Illinois, the air carries a crisp and cool feel, with current temperatures hovering in the mid 30s. The calmness of the night is punctuated by a gentle breeze, although it can occasionally turn gusty, reflecting the wintry atmosphere typical for this season. With the clear sky overhead, it is a peaceful, albeit chilly, evening along Lake Michigan.\n\nLooking ahead to the day, expect mostly cloudy skies overnight giving way to a partly sunny Tuesday. Daytime highs will rise to the low 40s, tapering off to the upper 30s in the afternoon. This shift brings a blend of cool and slightly overcast weather befitting the early winter scene, where brisk winds may add a bite to the air. Given the absence of precipitation and the relatively calm lake conditions, this day could be perfect for bundled-up strolls along the shoreline or a visit to the local parks. As we embrace this chilly December day, dress warmly with layers, including a heavy coat, gloves, and a hat to ward off the cool breezes.",
