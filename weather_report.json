    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a damp, overcast scene, as heavy rain and dense fog fill the air. The temperature rests in the mid-60s, accompanied by a fierce gusty wind. With humidity saturating the atmosphere, the experience is decidedly muggy and unsettled. As we look ahead, a wet overnight forecast awaits, promising showers and thunderstorms, some potentially intense, with low temperatures dipping to the low 60s. The wind will continue to sweep in from the south, bringing gusts that could reach up to 35 miles per hour. Tuesday will see more rain and thunderstorms, with daytime highs hovering around the mid-60s, making for a cloudy and potentially turbulent day.\n\nGiven the current weather conditions, outdoor plans may not fare well. The choppy waters of Lake Michigan will likely be uninviting, and visibility will be diminished by fog and rain. Attire that suits this weather calls for waterproof gear and warm layers, as the mid-60s can feel quite chill alongside the wet winds. While the fall season typically brings in crisp, clear days, this forecast diverges sharply from the seasonal expectations, leaning more towards an early winter feel. Activities that might fit this dreary day could include a cozy afternoon at a local caf\u00e9 or exploring indoor cultural venues, as nature\u2019s currents dictate a retreat from the elements.",
