    "weather_report": "Current weather conditions in Evanston are quite chilly, with the temperature hovering in the low 20s, accompanied by a brisk and blustery wind that adds a biting edge to the air. The atmosphere is largely overcast, lending a gray hue to the surroundings, where hints of sunlight may struggle to break through the cloud cover. Today's forecast expects a shift to partly sunny skies as the day progresses, reaching a high near the freezing point. Tonight, the sky will remain mostly cloudy with temperatures gently rising as the evening unfolds.\n\nAs for the waves lapping against the shores of Lake Michigan, they are moderate, whipped into a gentle froth by the wind, which creates a picturesque, albeit brisk setting by the beach. With the likelihood of dry conditions throughout the day, attire should lean toward layered warm clothing, perhaps including a windbreaker to combat the chill, along with a scarf and gloves for added comfort. This mid-winter day is reflective of the typical climate for the season here in the Midwest, making it ideal for bundling up and enjoying a stroll along the beach or visiting one of the nearby parks, provided one is well-prepared for the conditions.",
