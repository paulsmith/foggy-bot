    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently under the spell of a murky afternoon, with temperatures lingering in the mid 40s and a persistent cloak of fog casting a veil over the scenery. The air feels damp and chilling, a precursor to the sharper bite of winter that is setting in. Stepping outside, one encounters a howling wind that brings a briskness to the otherwise muted atmosphere. While the forecast hints at patchy drizzle and even a slight chance of rain later in the day, the main story is the cloud cover, which will remain thick as we transition into evening, with the temperature dipping into the high 20s.\n\nConditions at the beach reveal gentle waves lapping against the shore, but the blustery winds may stir up slightly more vigor as the day progresses. With this mix of fog, wind, and chilliness, attire should lean towards heavy jackets, hats, and perhaps a scarf to ward off the creeping cold, preferably layered, as temperatures will continue to fluctuate. Given the late November seasonality, these conditions are typical as the region heads deeper into winter, but they still carry a certain somber beauty. For those craving outdoor activity, it may be best to plan brief excursions rather than extended stays\u2014perhaps a walk along the shoreline to enjoy the bracing air or gathering with friends in cozy indoor spaces, as the spirit of the Thanksgiving season is still in the air, although no major holidays loom immediately ahead.",
