    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Evanston, the chill is palpable, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s. The atmosphere is thick with cloud cover, setting a moody scene as a brisk wind sweeps off Lake Michigan, turning what might be a pleasant coastal outing into a more blustery experience. The forecast hints at the possibility of snow beginning mid-afternoon, with a 50% chance of accumulation that could dust the area with less than half an inch before twilight descends.\n\nLooking ahead, expect a transition to snow this evening, potentially mixing with rain as temperatures creep back up to the mid-30s. It's a day where bundling up is not just advisable but essential\u2014layering with a warm coat, gloves, and perhaps a sturdy hat is recommended for venturing outdoors. The sandy beach may seem less inviting under the heavy cloud cover and with the impending precipitation, but for the brave souls willing to brave the elements, an invigorating winter walk could be just the thing to lift the spirits. With today being just a week before Christmas, one can almost feel the anticipation of the season in the air, even if it carries the crisp bite of winter.",
