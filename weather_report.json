    "weather_report": "This morning in Evanston, the air carries a chill, with temperatures resting in the low 30s and a brisk northwesterly wind stirring at about 25 miles per hour. The sky hangs heavy with clouds, setting a gloomy yet serene atmosphere as snow is likely to drape the area overnight. Today will see a chance of light snow before 8 a.m., and though the high is projected to reach just above freezing, the temperature will dip further by the afternoon. \n\nAs for the beach scene, the waves will remain subdued but may carry a crisp bite, while snow flurries may lightly dust the shoreline, creating a stark contrast against the winter landscape. Given the cool and overcast conditions, it\u2019s advisable to don warm layers, perhaps a heavy coat, gloves, and a scarf, to stave off the chill. In terms of activities, this is a day better suited for indoor pursuits or a brisk walk along the waterfront, where one can admire the stark beauty of winter on Lake Michigan. \n\nWith the upcoming festive season in mind, this chilly December day calls for warm drinks and cozy gatherings. While it's not a holiday today, keep your spirits bright with the holiday season just around the corner.",
