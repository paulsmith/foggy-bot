    "weather_report": "This morning in Evanston, the temperature hovers in the low 50s, creating a chill in the air alongside a persistent dampness, making it feel brisk and cool. The clouds blanket the sky, casting a muted light over the beach, which appears calm, albeit with hints of wave action gently lapping against the shore. Throughout the day, a chance of rain and patchy drizzle is expected, particularly before and after midday. As temperatures creep toward the high 40s in the afternoon, gusty northwest winds, reaching up to 20 mph, will add to the chill, elevating the need for layered clothing.\n\nTonight, skies remain mostly cloudy with the temperature dropping into the upper 20s, so it's wise to bundle up well against the brisk west-northwest winds. Given the late November timing, the conditions are typical for the season\u2014cool and overcast, perfect for winter preparation but perhaps less suited for outdoor leisure. For those venturing out, warm coats and perhaps an umbrella would be prudent, while the damp beach may not entice many for leisurely strolls. Instead, a cozy indoor activity, such as visiting local cafes or museums, might be more appealing on this gray day.",
