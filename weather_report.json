The sky is mostly cloudy, painting a gray canvas above, which hints at the impending mix of rain and snow later tonight. With winds howling from the southeast, excitement builds for the hours ahead as there\u2019s a robust chance of precipitation. Expect less than half an inch of snow, accompanied by drizzle and patchy fog that may make the waterfront a bit dreary.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, we can anticipate areas of fog and drizzle in the morning, likely giving way to a high in the low 40s by afternoon. While the temperatures are gradually falling, conditions remain damp and cloudy, wrapping Evanston in a shroud",
