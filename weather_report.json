    "weather_report": "As we survey the current conditions in Evanston, Illinois, we find ourselves enveloped in a wintry scene marked by light freezing rain mixed with snow, accompanied by a thick fog that casts a steely gloom over the beach. The temperature sits in the low 30s, with a fierce wind howling from the south-southeast, adding a biting chill to the damp air. This is not the fairest of evenings to be outside\u2014indeed, visibility is severely limited, and the landscape appears subdued and gray, typical of a late December night in the Midwest.\n\nLooking ahead to the night, expect a continuation of snow before transitioning to a wintry mix as temperatures hover around the low 30s, rising slightly overnight. A brisk breeze will persist, with gusts strong enough to make even the sturdiest of winter coats feel inadequate. Precipitation will likely accumulate with a chance of snow likely exceeding one inch, creating slick surfaces ahead. For those venturing out, layering up with a warm, waterproof coat, gloves, and sturdy boots is advisable, as conditions remain anything but inviting. Given that today is an ordinary weekday in the midst of the holiday season, indoor activities may be preferable for most. However, for the brave-hearted, a brisk walk along the beach offers a chance to experience nature at its most formidable, though caution is warranted due to the slippery terrain.",
