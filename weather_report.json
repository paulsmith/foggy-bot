    "weather_report": "The current weather in Evanston presents a brisk and decidedly frosty morning, with temperatures in the mid to upper 20s and a clear sky that hints at crisp visibility. However, the atmosphere feels sharper due to a formidable breeze kicking up from the west, lending an invigorating bite to the air. As the day unfolds, residents can expect plenty of sunshine, though temperatures will gradually rise to the upper 30s before settling in the afternoon around 37. A slight chance of some flurries and rainflakes may flirt with the overnight hours, under mostly cloudy conditions with lows approaching the low 30s, but significant accumulation is unlikely.\n\nThe beach scene along Lake Michigan, while refreshingly clear, may present a rather chillier aspect today, with the wind creating noticeable wave action along the shore. The potential precipitation later tonight, although minimal, adds a slight chill to the forecast. Given these conditions, dressing warmly in layers is highly advisable; a cozy winter coat, perhaps a hat and gloves, would make ventures outside more enjoyable. Despite the wintry feel, this weather is typical for late November in the Midwest, characterized by seasonal chilliness and occasional inclement weather. While outdoor activities might be limited by the cold, a brisk walk along the lake or a visit to a local caf\u00e9 could be pleasant ways to embrace the day.",
