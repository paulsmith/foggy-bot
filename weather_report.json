    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a brisk, cold morning with temperatures hovering in the upper 20s. A gentle breeze from the west southwest stirs through the air, making the atmosphere feel notably chillier. Despite the bite in the air, the day starts with a mostly clear sky, revealing the tranquil waters of Lake Michigan. However, as we move into the afternoon, expect a shift as scattered rain and snow showers are forecasted to emerge, likely starting after 3 PM. The high today will reach into the upper 30s, but the temperature is expected to dip later, with gusty winds possibly enhancing the chill, creating wind chill values that could plummet to around -4 tonight.\n\nGiven the forecast, it's advisable to dress warmly, layering up in insulated coats, scarves, and gloves to combat both the cold and the impending moisture. While waves on the lake could exhibit a bit of a chop due to the wind, the new snow accumulation expected to be minimal means that major disruptions are unlikely for outdoor plans. Seasonal temperatures remain consistent for early December, so consider this a typical chilly day in the Midwest as we approach the heart of winter. If you're looking for an outdoor activity this morning, a walk along the beach or in nearby parks could be invigorating, though later in the day might be better suited for cozy indoor pursuits as the weather shifts.",
