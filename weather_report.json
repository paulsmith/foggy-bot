    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston paint a distinctly brisk picture. With temperatures hovering in the mid-30s, a blend of cool air and moisture hangs in the atmosphere, producing a chilling effect. The scene is somewhat blustery, as winds whip through the area at a fierce pace, underscoring the chilly feel of the night. The sky is largely clear of rain but carries a blanket of mostly cloudy hues, which stifles any lingering warmth.\n\nAs we look ahead to the day, Tuesday is projected to bring sunshine with a high near 40, yet those temperatures will gradually decline throughout the afternoon. Gusty winds will accompany clear skies, though you may find it feel a bit more comfortable than the current evening chill. The wave conditions along Lake Michigan are likely to remain moderate, complementing the already lively gusts. Given the seasonal context, this weather is representative of late November, fitting snugly within expectations for temperatures and conditions typical of the Midwest. For outdoor ventures, layered attire is advisable\u2014perhaps a warm jacket, scarf, and sturdy footwear\u2014ideal for a stroll along the beach, appreciating the beauty of a wintery shoreline. As this evening unfolds into Monday, keep in mind that while it may feel nippy now, the sunlight beckons a fresh and cheerful winter day ahead.",
