    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a cool day with temperatures lingering in the low 50s, presenting a pleasantly crisp atmosphere that aligns with late autumn's charm. The skies are mostly overcast, lending a soft, muted hue to the scenery, while a blustery wind whistles from the southeast, making it feel a touch cooler. As we move through the day, expect the cloud cover to persist, with a forecast high near 53 degrees. Later this afternoon, temperatures will likely dip slightly lower, presenting a typical autumn feel for this time of year.\n\nThe potential for rain showers arises tonight, particularly after 3 AM, introducing a slight chance of dampness to an otherwise cloudy evening. For those venturing outdoors, it\u2019s advisable to dress in layers, favoring light jackets or sweaters to combat the brisk winds and cooler temperatures. Wave conditions on the lake may be moderate given the gusty winds, but should remain manageable for those curious enough to enjoy a late stroll along the beach. While the day may not call for festive activities, the tranquil beach setting remains inviting for contemplative walks, particularly as the holidays approach.",
