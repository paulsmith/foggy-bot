    "weather_report": "As evening settles over Evanston, current conditions reveal a chilly and cloudy atmosphere, with temperatures in the low 20s brushed by a fierce, swirling breeze. The gusty winds, coming from the southwest, add a biting edge to the air, giving the scene a brisk, wintry feel typical for this time of year. Tonight, expect mostly cloudy skies with temperatures hovering around the low 20s before slightly rising to settle near 26 by morning\u2014a stark reminder of the season.\n\nLooking ahead to Wednesday, scattered snow showers are anticipated after 2 PM, indicating the likelihood of a wintry mix that busy locals should prepare for. Temperatures will climb to the high 30s but will drop back into the low 30s by afternoon as a blustery wind from the west southwest, gusting to near 45 mph, adds another layer of chill to the day. As the waves lap along Lake Michigan, conditions will likely be rough but not particularly inviting for outdoor activities, suggesting that layered clothing is advisable for anyone venturing outside. Given the overall atmosphere\u2014a blend of biting cold and cloud cover\u2014the day may not be ideal for outdoor excursions, so consider cozying up indoors with a warm drink.",
