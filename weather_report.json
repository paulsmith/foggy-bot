    "weather_report": "The current weather in Evanston brings a chill to the air, with temperatures hovering in the upper 30s along with a moderate breeze out of the west. Under mostly cloudy skies, the conditions feel crisp and invigorating, certainly invigorating for those who crave a taste of winter. The evening will see a transition to mostly clear skies, allowing for colder air to settle in as temperatures dip toward the low 20s. Tomorrow, residents can expect sunny weather with a high reaching the low 30s, though the chill will linger as the temperatures fall slightly in the afternoon.\n\nWave conditions along Lake Michigan are likely to be moderately stirred due to the current wind, making the shoreline appear lively, but cautious onlookers should be aware of the cooling winds. There is no precipitation anticipated for tonight or through the first half of the week, making for pleasant outdoor conditions, albeit quite cold. Dressing warmly will be essential; layers, including a hearty coat, gloves, and a hat, will make for a more comfortable experience outdoors. While winter weather may not be the ideal time for beach outings, a brisk walk along the frozen shoreline or enjoying a warm beverage from a nearby caf\u00e9 could fit the bill, capturing the essence of this frosty winter day.",
