    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently experiencing a chill that is characteristic of mid-December, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s and a dampness in the air that makes it feel even cooler. The wind is quite gusty, stirring the atmosphere and adding a bite to the already cloudy expanse overhead. As the day progresses, expect snow to blanket the area overnight, likely dusting the beach and the nearby parks. Tomorrow, the chance of morning snow lingers, although the temperature will inch ever so slightly up to the mid-30s, presenting a landscape that might seem dreary for outdoor excursions.\n\nDespite the wet conditions, the sight of Lake Michigan can still hold its own kind of beauty. However, the wave conditions are likely to reflect the gusty winds, making it a less than ideal time for boating or fishing. Those venturing outside should bundle up in warm layers\u2014perhaps a heavy coat, gloves, and a scarf\u2014to combat the chill effectively. With the holidays approaching, this weather sets a fitting backdrop for enjoying cozy indoor activities. While outdoor adventures might be curtailed by the weather, consider embracing the season with a warm drink while watching the snow fall, reflecting the warmth of the community spirit during this festive time of year.",
