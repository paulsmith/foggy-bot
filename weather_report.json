    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently enveloped in a chilly embrace, with temperatures hovering in the mid to upper 40s, where the air feels damp and steely from the persistent light rain and mist. The atmosphere carries a pronounced heaviness, as humidity clings uncomfortably to the skin, making the conditions feel even cooler. The wind is spirited, blowing from the southeast with occasional gusts, adding an invigorating element to an otherwise dreary scene.\n\nLooking ahead, the city can expect rain to continue throughout the night, with temperatures only creeping upward slightly to the low 50s by morning, driven by a gentle southeast breeze. As the day progresses, rain is likely to linger until mid-afternoon, when conditions may hold steady around the low 50s before dipping again. The precipitation forecast suggests a significant accumulation, with a chance of nearly an inch, creating rather blustery and unfriendly conditions along the lakeshore. The waves on Lake Michigan will likely be restless, influenced by the powerful winds, making the beach an uninviting sight for leisurely activities. In this season, a chill like this is typical, marking the depths of late autumn in the Midwest\u2014best suited for cozy gatherings indoors. With such weather, layering is essential; a waterproof jacket and sturdy shoes will serve one well against the persistent chill and moisture. Today is an ordinary Tuesday, devoid of notable holidays, making it a prime time to retreat indoors with a good book or perhaps catch a local film as the weather outside grows steadily more inclement.",
