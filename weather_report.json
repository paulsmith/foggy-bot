    "weather_report": "As the sun rises over Evanston, the air carries a brisk chill with temperatures hovering in the low single digits. The day begins mostly cloudy, but expect some breaks of blue sky as we move toward the afternoon when conditions will shift to partly sunny. Despite the promise of some sun, wind chill will be a significant factor, with values dipping as low as -8 due to a fierce breeze coming from the west, adding an extra bite to the already chilly atmosphere. This is typical for December in this region, where the winter chill can feel particularly penetrating.\n\nThe waves along Lake Michigan are likely elevated with this gusty wind, making for a brisk shoreline\u2014a picturesque view, yet too raw for leisurely outdoor strolls without proper attire. For those venturing out, layering is essential, with recommended attire including a warm winter coat, gloves, and a hat to shield against the cold. Today's high will struggle to reach the mid-teens as we slide into the evening, where temperatures will settle around the low single digits with mostly clear skies. There's no precipitation in sight, which is fortunate, allowing for outdoor activities if one is adequately bundled up. While it may not be the most inviting day for beach fun, cozy indoor activities or holiday preparations may offer a more comfortable alternative, especially as the festive season approaches.",
