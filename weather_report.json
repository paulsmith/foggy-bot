    "weather_report": "As Evanston transitions into the night, the current conditions reveal a cool and brisk atmosphere, with temperatures nestled in the upper 40s and winds howling, creating a noticeable bite in the air. The sky is mostly cloudy, adding a dim ambiance to the evening. Looking ahead, the forecast suggests a shift towards clearer skies as tonight progresses, with temperatures dipping to the low 30s and lingering winds gusting from the west. Tomorrow promises a sunny day, albeit cool, with a high reaching just shy of 40 and continued breezy conditions.\n\nIn terms of outdoor activities, the evening is best suited for a cozy night indoors, perhaps in front of a fire, as the chill lingers, and the fierce winds could bring an unsettling chill. For those braving the elements, layering up with a warm jacket is essential, especially as tomorrow\u2019s high will only embrace the coolness, making it advisable to opt for warm attire when stepping outside. The season is firmly winter here in the Midwest, and tonight's cool temperatures align well with what one might expect at this time of year. While precipitation isn\u2019t in the forecast, the winds will likely generate some rough wave conditions along Lake Michigan, creating an impressive yet potentially hazardous shoreline. As the evening settles, keep warm and consider the beauty of winter's quietude.",
