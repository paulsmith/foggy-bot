    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the morning unfolds under a blanket of fog, with temperatures hovering in the low 40s and a palpable chill lingering in the air. The atmosphere is decidedly dreary, marked by a strong, gusty wind that adds to the uninviting conditions. As the day progresses, we can expect rain and occasional thunderstorms until early afternoon, transitioning to a chance of wintry precipitation later in the day. High temperatures will barely reach the upper end of the 30s, dropping to around 35 as afternoon approaches. A substantial amount of rain is anticipated, totaling between half an inch to three-quarters, making outdoor plans seem less than ideal.\n\nTonight brings a slight reprieve with partly cloudy skies and temperatures dipping to the upper 20s, but the north-northeast winds will persist, remaining brisk and biting. Given the season, these temperatures are typical for early February along the shores of Lake Michigan. Attire should be geared toward warmth, favoring thermal layers, waterproof outerwear, and a reliable umbrella to navigate the wet conditions. While outdoor activities are best shunned, cozy indoor pursuits with friends or books might be more appealing on this chilly, damp day.",
