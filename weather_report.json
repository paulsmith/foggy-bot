    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a chilly scene, with temperatures lingering in the low teens and a blustery wind from the south delivering a biting chill. The cloud-covered sky casts a muted light over the beach, adding to the wintry atmosphere. Today's forecast hints at a slight chance of snow after the afternoon, with temperatures expected to reach the upper 20s later, transitioning into a snowier evening. Snow is likely overnight, bringing with it the possibility of 1 to 3 inches of accumulation. The winds, gusty and vigorous, could make for some rather wild conditions along the lakeshore.\n\nGiven the current winter chill and overcast skies, dressing warmly with layers is essential; a heavy coat, hats, gloves, and sturdy boots are recommended for those venturing outside. As for activities, it may be a good time for indoor pursuits or perhaps a brisk walk along the beach\u2014provided one is properly bundled up. The frigid temperatures are typical for a mid-February day in the Midwest, a time when winter still holds its grasp tightly. The day also holds the significance of Valentine's Day, which might bring a few more souls outside as they seek to enjoy the cozy, romantic charm of the season, though they should be wary of the impending snowfall.",
