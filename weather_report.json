    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a rather bleak scene, as light drizzle and dense fog envelop the area. With temperatures in the low 40s and blustery winds from the southeast, the atmosphere feels damp and chilly, creating a distinctly wintry environment just shy of the official start of winter. Visibility is limited, and the forecast for the day indicates an ongoing chance of rain showers, especially before dawn, followed by intermittent fog and potentially more drizzle as temperatures hover around the high 30s overnight.\n\nAs we look ahead to the day, expect cloudy skies with a high reaching near 50 in the afternoon, but temperatures will tend to drop back into the low 40s. While there remains a slight chance of rain, the overall wave conditions on Lake Michigan are likely calm due to the moderating winds, although occasional gusts could add some degree of chop. Given today\u2019s chilly temperatures and moist air, dressing warmly with layers and waterproof outerwear is advisable for anyone venturing out. Although it's not a holiday today, the atmosphere may discourage outdoor festivities, making it a good day to enjoy cozy indoor activities or perhaps explore local cafes while watching the fog roll over the lake.",
