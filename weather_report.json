    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly and brisk atmosphere, with temperatures in the low 30s and a considerable breeze gusting fiercely from the north-northwest. The air feels quite sharp, with a partly cloudy sky allowing brief glimpses of the stars or morning light as the night unfolds. The forecast for the day suggests that temperatures will hover around the high 20s, edging slightly upward overnight. Expect a partly sunny day, with winds remaining noticeable but more tempered than current conditions, leading to a more manageable feel.\n\nWave conditions along Lake Michigan may be somewhat choppy, typical for this time of year, making for a rather tumultuous scene along the shore. There are no signs of precipitation today, which adds to the pleasant aspects of an otherwise cool winter day. Given the briskness, warm layers are advisable when heading outside; think down jackets and perhaps a cozy scarf to shield against the wind. For activities, albeit not a major holiday today, those seeking a brisk walk along the beach or through the nearby parks may find the scenery invigorating, despite the chilly air. Overall, while winter's bite persists, the day promises nothing threatening in terms of weather, just a crisp reminder of the season's grasp.",
