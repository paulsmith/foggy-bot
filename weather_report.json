    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather reflects a biting chill, with temperatures hovering in the low 20s, accompanied by a brisk northwest wind that adds a layer of intensity to the chilly atmosphere. The skies are mostly clear, presenting a crisp and sharp appearance, fostering a sense of tranquility despite the cold. Tonight, expect the temperature to drop further, reaching a low in the single digits, and with wind chill making it feel even colder\u2014closer to 1 degree.\n\nTomorrow promises a sunny respite with temperatures peaking in the upper 20s, but residents should not be fooled; the wind chill will still bite, dipping down to around 0 degrees throughout the day. Although precipitation is absent from the forecast, the undulating Lake Michigan may offer some turbulence, with waves likely roused by the earlier gusty conditions. Attire should be geared towards warmth, favoring thick coats, hats, gloves, and insulated boots, suitable for this time of year when winter's grip is firmly in place. While the temperatures are typical for February in the Midwest, with this mix of sunlight and chill, opportunities for brisk walks along the beach abound, making for a refreshing outing before warmer days come.",
