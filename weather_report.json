    "weather_report": "As temperatures sit in the mid 30s this evening in Evanston, the air is brisk and damp, creating a chilly atmosphere that feels notably colder with the brisk winds howling at 62 miles per hour. The clouds linger heavily overhead, signaling an impending mix of rain and snow that will start around midnight, transitioning into patchy fog and drizzle through the early morning hours. Tonight, expect a low of around 32, with a 70% chance of precipitation possibly leading to minor snowfall accumulation.\n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, areas of fog and light drizzle will persist, creating overcast conditions throughout the day. The high will struggle to reach the low 40s, ultimately dipping into the late afternoon. With a breeze blowing gently from the south-southwest at about 10 to 15 miles per hour, it's a day best spent indoors. Given the seasonal chill typical for February in this region, the weather strongly suggests bundling up in layers, with warmth taking precedent in attire. Light outdoor activities or errands might be feasible, but with the visibility reduced and wet conditions expected, enjoying the comforts of home would make for a far more pleasant experience.",
