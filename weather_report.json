Wind gusts sweep in from the southwest, briskly rustling leaves and adding a distinct edge to the air. Tonight's forecast hints at a slight chance of rain before dawn, with drizzles possible, yet any substantial precipitation remains minimal. \n\nLooking ahead to Monday, residents can expect a shift to partially sunny conditions, peaking around the low 50s before slipping back into the afternoon chill. The beach by Lake Michigan, while not inviting for swimming, offers a serene retreat for those wishing to stroll along the shoreline. With gusty winds and cool, gray skies, it's a day better suited for light layers\u2014perhaps a warm sweater and a light jacket would suffice. This time of year is typical for the region, as the sharpness of winter begins to encroach, reminding locals that the holiday season is just around the corner, enriched by the spirit of community and festivity.",
