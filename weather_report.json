    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois reveal a cold and brisk morning, with temperatures hovering in the low single digits and a noticeable, biting wind that adds to the chill. The clear skies offer a contrast to the chill in the air, making it feel particularly crisp and invigorating for anyone venturing outdoors. As the day progresses, expect a shift in the weather with a forecast promising partly sunny skies and a high in the upper 20s. Tonight, clouds will gather more significantly, with temperatures notably rising to around 27 by morning. \n\nWhile wave conditions on Lake Michigan appear relatively calm, be cautious of the wind gusts that will enhance the chill factor throughout the day. With no precipitation expected, it will be a dry day despite the cool temperatures. Dress warmly, favoring layers that include a sturdy coat, scarf, and hat to ward off the chill. Given the current season, these temperatures are typical for mid-December in the Midwest, so outdoor activities might be limited. However, a stroll along the beach could still be refreshing, especially for those who revel in the winter air.",
