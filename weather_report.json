    "weather_report": "As the current afternoon unfolds in Evanston, a blustery and chilly atmosphere blankets the area, with temperatures hovering in the low 50s, accompanied by a rather high humidity level. The clouds loom heavy above, contributing to a gray and uninviting sky. Looking ahead, expect a significant shift as rain rolls in later today, particularly after 5 PM. The high will reach only the mid-50s, with a southeast wind picking up strength, ushering in the precipitation with a near certainty of 100%. Overnight, temperatures will rise slightly, remaining around the low 50s\u2014a warm setup for a chilly November night.\n\nThe beach today, though rugged and wild with the choppy lake waves, is best viewed from the comfort of a warm jacket, possibly with a raincoat if venturing out, as soon the skies could unleash a substantial amount of rain, up to an inch in total. Given the season, these conditions are typical for mid-November in the Midwest\u2014but the anticipated rain and high winds might deter outdoor activities. It's a day best suited for cozy indoor pastimes or perhaps enjoying a warm beverage while watching the lake's tumultuous yet captivating waves through a window. With no major holidays or events marking this date, locals may find solace in a quiet, contemplative afternoon.",
