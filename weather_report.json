    "weather_report": "As the night unfolds over Evanston, a chill hangs in the air, with cloud cover emphasizing the crispness of a late autumn evening. The temperature dips to around 40 degrees, accentuated by a brisk wind from the northwest that rustles through the bare branches and raises the occasional gust, reaching up to 35 mph. This atmospheric backdrop sets the stage for tomorrow\u2019s shift; the dawn will likely greet us with clear skies and a sun ready to break through the clouds, bringing a mild peak of 52 degrees by midday.\n\nFor those venturing out on this Friday, attire should reflect the coolness\u2014a layered ensemble, perhaps a warm sweater beneath a light jacket, will provide both comfort and defense against the wind. It\u2019s a fitting day for activities that appreciate the season. A morning stroll along the beach could be refreshing, as fewer crowds and a tranquil Lake Michigan offer a moment of solace. One might also consider visiting local shops, where the warmth indoors contrasts nicely with the crispness outside, or enjoying a muted coffee outside to soak in the serenity of a re-emerging sunny day. While the lake remains uninviting for swimming, its waves are likely calm, presenting an almost reflective surface under the expected clear skies, a picturesque setting for contemplative moments or leisurely walks.\n\nFor color representing the evening and forecast, a rich deep blue () captures both the night sky and the promise of a sunny day ahead.",
