    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current scene is marked by a chilly embrace, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s. The air carries a biting crispness, accentuated by a steady and gusty wind that adds a wild edge to the landscape. Light freezing drizzle accompanied by fog creates a haunting atmosphere along the lakeshore, blurring the line between land and water as waves lap silently against the shore.\n\nAs night approaches, expect a transition, as snow is likely to unfold before 1 AM, giving in later to a mix of rain and snow. The temperature will dip slightly, settling around 30 degrees but may rise to the mid-30s overnight. A strong southwest wind will be felt, so dress warmly in layers; a sturdy coat, gloves, and a hat are essential. The waves along Lake Michigan will likely be choppy, influenced by the gusty winds, and may not be suitable for evening strolls. While it's not officially a holiday, the upcoming festive spirit is palpable in the air, encouraging indoor activities such as cozy gatherings or holiday baking as the winter chill continues to deepen.",
