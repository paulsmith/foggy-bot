    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the current weather is decidedly cool and cloudy, with temperatures hovering in the upper 40s accompanied by a damp chill from moderate humidity. With the wind bustling at a brisk pace from the southeast, it adds to the chilliness, creating a somewhat blustery day with a touch of dreariness. The forecast for today indicates persistent cloud cover with temperatures gradually dipping to the low 50s by afternoon, so expect a day that feels refreshing but perhaps a bit uncomfortable if you\u2019re unprepared.\n\nAs twilight approaches, a slight chance of rain showers is anticipated after 3 AM, with temperatures settling around 47 degrees overnight. As the waves of Lake Michigan churn gently under this overcast sky, conditions might not lend themselves to pleasant seaside strolls. It would be wise to bundle up with layered clothing, including a warm jacket and perhaps a hat, especially if navigating the beach area where the wind feels stronger. This time of year typically ushers in slightly chilly weather, aligning with autumn conditions, making today\u2019s temperatures fall right in line with what\u2019s expected for mid-November. Given the shifting landscape with holiday festivities on the horizon, activities could lean towards indoor enjoyment, well-suited for a cozy afternoon in a caf\u00e9 or browsing local shops.",
