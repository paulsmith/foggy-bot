    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a fresh, brisk atmosphere, characterized by a temperature in the low 40s with a notable, gusty wind sweeping in from the southwest. The skies are mostly cloudy, lending a somewhat muted tone to the day, though visibility remains clear enough to appreciate the beauty of the shoreline and Lake Michigan. This afternoon, expect the clouds to persist, with temperatures rising only slightly, peaking near the mid 40s. Evening will bring partly cloudy skies and a gradual cool down towards the upper 30s, as the wind continues to whisper and sway, calming from its midday vigor.\n\nWave conditions along the lake are likely to be moderate, influenced by the blustery winds, making it a less than ideal time for those looking to venture onto the water. As for attire, it's advisable to dress warmly in layers\u2014perhaps a sturdy coat paired with a scarf and hat\u2014to fend off the chill. Given that it\u2019s early December, these temperatures align with seasonal norms, reflecting the advancing winter season. Suitable activities this afternoon may include a brisk walk along the beach while enjoying the crisp air or a cozy retreat to a local caf\u00e9 to warm up, as the day brings no significant precipitation.",
