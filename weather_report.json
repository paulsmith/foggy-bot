    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a blustery scene, with light rain falling and temperatures settling into the upper 50s, creating a damp and slightly chilly atmosphere. With gusty winds tearing through at nearly 54 miles per hour, the surroundings may feel quite fierce, and the overcast skies add to the somber mood, making it less than ideal for outdoor enjoyment. Rain is forecasted to continue overnight, with a low dropping to around 55 degrees and temperatures slowly rising by morning, setting the stage for a gray and drizzly start to the new day.\n\nAs Tuesday unfolds, expect a chance of light rain showers before mid-morning, alongside mostly cloudy skies. The high will hover around the upper 50s, typical for late autumn in this region, as temperatures gradually decline in the afternoon. Wave conditions along the lakeshore may be robust, a reflection of the howling winds, possibly churning the waters of Lake Michigan. Those heading outdoors are advised to wear layers, including a waterproof jacket, and sturdy footwear to combat the soggy terrain. With today not designated as a notable holiday, it\u2019s best to keep indoor plans in mind, perhaps visiting local cafes or museums rather than braving the elements outside.",
