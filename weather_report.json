    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a chilly, murky atmosphere as temperatures hover in the low 40s, with a gentle, whispering breeze barely stirring the air. The day, under a shroud of mostly cloudy skies, lacks brightness, confirming the presence of an impending shift as precipitation is expected later this evening. As night approaches, rain showers are likely to develop, particularly between 9 PM and 3 AM, adding to the cool, enveloping feel of the night with temperatures potentially dipping to the low 30s.\n\nThe beach scene reflects an unwelcoming appearance for outdoor activities today, with wave conditions appearing relatively calm, though the rough terrain of the Lake Michigan shoreline suggests caution for those considering water activities. Given the cool and damp environment, it\u2019s advisable to dress warmly in layers, perhaps incorporating a waterproof jacket, as conditions could turn wet. Typical for late November in this region, these temperatures align with seasonal expectations, offering reminders of winter's slow approach. Evening strolls along the shoreline may be pleasant but should be executed with an awareness of the chilly air and potential rain. With no major holidays on the calendar today, the focus remains on enjoying these typical winter days while preparing for what lies ahead.",
