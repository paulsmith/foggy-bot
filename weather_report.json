    "weather_report": "The current conditions in Evanston present a rather bracing snapshot of winter's grip, with temperatures falling into the low teens. The air feels sharp, accentuated by a fierce wind that sweeps across the landscape, stirring up a brisk chill that demands attention. It's mostly clear at this hour, allowing glimpses of a brightening sky, but the reality remains that with wind gusts shaking the trees and the promise of occasional snow showers before noon, this morning carries a sense of wintry urgency.\n\nAs the day unfolds, residents can expect a gradual warming trend, albeit still within the mid to upper 20s. While the afternoon may bring some respite from the biting cold, the wind chill could plummet to a bone-numbing -3. Tonight, temperatures will dip further, settling around 16 under partly cloudy skies. Those venturing outdoors should consider layering up; hats and gloves will be essential as the breezy conditions deepen the cold's bite. With wave conditions on Lake Michigan likely to be choppy, water activities are best avoided, but a brisk walk by the shoreline could invigorate the spirit. Though not a holiday today, the season itself is undeniably festive, making it a fine opportunity to enjoy the beauty of winter\u2014perhaps a warm drink after a spirited stroll along the beach.",
