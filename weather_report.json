    "weather_report": "In Evanston today, the chilly air carries a damp, brisk feeling as the temperature hovers in the upper 40s, complemented by a gentle yet persistent breeze from the southeast. Overcast skies blanket the region, with the calm surface of Lake Michigan revealing slight ripples, prime indicators of the day's blustery tendencies. As we look ahead to the afternoon, expect mostly cloudy conditions with temperatures inching closer to 50 degrees. A shift in the winds will bring a light touch, with gusts potentially reaching 20 miles per hour.\n\nAs evening approaches, the chance of patchy drizzle followed by scattered showers brings a layer of gray to the already overcast sky, as temperatures dip into the upper 40s. Attire recommendations for this late November day include layers to combat the cool, clammy conditions, perhaps with a waterproof jacket on hand as the evening progresses. The current temperature is typical for this time of year along the Midwest lakes, providing that crisp seasonal charm, though the clouds and moist air may make it feel a touch more uninviting. This weekend marks an ideal time for cozy indoor activities or a brisk walk along the beach, but be prepared for a light sprinkle should you venture out.",
