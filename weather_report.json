    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois reveal a crisp, cool atmosphere with temperatures firmly in the mid-30s accompanied by a light breeze. As the evening unfolds, cloud cover blankets the sky, giving it a somewhat muted appearance. Tonight, residents should be aware of a slight chance of snow, particularly before dawn, although any accumulation is expected to be minimal. The low will settle around the low 30s, while a gentle south-southwest wind whispers through the area.\n\nAs we turn to tomorrow, Wednesday brings mostly cloudy skies with a high projected near the mid-40s, tapering off to around 42 degrees by afternoon. The day will continue to feel cool, ideal for bundling up in warm layers as the wind shifts to a soft breeze. With the waters of Lake Michigan nearby, wave conditions are likely to be calm, making for a serene coastal view. This late November weather reflects typical seasonal patterns, where the chill in the air invites cozy indoor activities rather than outdoor excursions. Given the forecast and the time of year, it\u2019s a suitable day for warm beverages indoors or quick outdoor errands\u2014the kind of day where a warm coat, hat, and perhaps gloves would be recommended.",
