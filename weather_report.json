    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current conditions are marked by a cozy chill in the air, indicative of early November, with temperatures hovering in the low 50s. The atmosphere is a blend of cool and humid, and the sky is cloaked in a thick blanket of clouds, lending a subdued light to the evening. There's a brisk, gusty breeze blowing in from the southeast that adds a sharpness to the coastal air, hinting at the proximity of Lake Michigan. Overnight, expect more clouds with a slight dip in temperatures, settling around the low 50s, accompanied by gentle but noticeable winds.\n\nAs we look ahead to Sunday, rain showers are likely to emerge after noon, transforming this cloudy weekend into a wet one. The skies will remain overcast, with temperatures climbing to near the low 60s before a slight drop in the afternoon. With a 60% chance of precipitation, it's wise to keep an umbrella handy, as the potential for light rain will be present throughout the day. The wave conditions along the lake may become choppy as the wind continues to whip up the waters. Given the seasonality of late autumn, today's weather is typical for this time of year\u2014rather crisp and damp, perfect for bundling up in jackets and scarves. Activities might be limited; however, a cozy day indoors with a warm drink or catching up on reading could be the perfect antidote to the dreary weather.",
