    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Evanston, the temperature lingers in the low 50s, creating a damp and humid atmosphere under a blanket of mostly cloudy skies. The brisk winds from the southeast whip through the air, stirring up the nearby waves on Lake Michigan, which may present a formidable sight as they crash against the shore. Tonight, expect rain showers before dawn, with a significant probability of precipitation lingering at 90%. New rainfall could amount to less than a tenth of an inch, yet the moisture will enhance the chill in the air.\n\nTomorrow will greet you with patchy drizzle in the morning, possibly giving way to some sunshine by the afternoon, though temperatures are expected to cap near the upper 50s and fall to the mid-50s as the day wears on. A blustery southwest wind could add to the mix, with gusts reaching up to 35 mph, making for a potentially gusty experience at the beach. Given these conditions, skirting the shoreline may be unpleasant, and attire should include waterproof layers and sturdy shoes to withstand the wind and sporadic rain. As we approach mid-November in this region, these temperatures are indeed typical for the season, presenting a quintessential autumnal chill. If you plan to venture out, consider indoor activities like visiting local caf\u00e9s or museums, as outdoor excursions may prove difficult given the expected precipitation and wind.",
