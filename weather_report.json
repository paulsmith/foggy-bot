    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently enveloped in a murky ambiance with temperatures hovering in the low 60s, and the air feels notably damp, creating a somewhat oppressive atmosphere. The wind is howling from the southeast, adding to the chill and restlessness of the night as clouds shroud the sky. Rain is imminent, with forecasts indicating a heavy downpour overnight, potentially accompanied by thunderstorms, as temperatures are expected to dip to the mid-50s.\n\nLooking ahead to Tuesday, the day will begin with a lingering chance of rain showers before dawn, gradually transitioning to mostly cloudy skies for the afternoon. The high will struggle to reach the upper 50s, with a brisk breeze continuing to sweep through the area. Considering the season, this overall weather pattern is typical for late fall in the Midwest, where cool, damp conditions prevail. Given these circumstances, one might consider wearing waterproof attire and sturdy shoes if venturing outdoors. As for activities, the weather may not be conducive to outdoor excursions; perhaps a cozy indoor outing or catching up on reading would provide the perfect respite from the impending rain.",
