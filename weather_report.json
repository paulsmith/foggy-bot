    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston paint a brisk picture as temperatures hover in the mid-20s, creating a crisp and cool atmosphere. The sky is cloaked in clouds, offering a dramatic backdrop as a fierce wind sweeps in from the west, raising the chill factor. The wave conditions along the shore of Lake Michigan are likely stirred up, reflecting the strong gusts and potential for intermittent snow showers overnight. \n\nAs we look forward to Friday, the weather forecast indicates a continuance of chilly conditions, with a high expected near the mid-20s. There is a slight chance of snow early, with cloudy skies prevailing throughout the day. Given the season, these temperatures are typical for late November in the Midwest, leading into winter, which suggests a cozy day indoors might be in someone's favor. For those who venture outside, layered attire is advisable to combat the cold, perhaps scarf and gloves to retain warmth against the brisk breeze. The days ahead present an opportunity to embrace indoor activities or perhaps take in the wintry scene from the comfort of home\u2014ideal for warm beverages and good company as the holiday season approaches.",
