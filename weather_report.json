    "weather_report": "A crisp and cool afternoon unfolds in Evanston, where current temperatures hover in the mid-20s. The sky is mostly clear, giving way to ample sunshine, but a blustery northwest wind whips through at around 10 mph, creating a refreshingly brisk atmosphere. Tonight, the forecast calls for continued clarity with temperatures dipping into the high teens, accompanied by gentle winds that promise a chilly evening.\n\nWave conditions along Lake Michigan appear to be moderate, with a gentle surf lapping at the shore. The lack of any precipitation enhances the pleasant outdoor experience, making it an ideal time for a brisk walk or a relaxing moment by the water. Given the season, these temperatures align well with typical December weather in the Midwest, where one should bundle up warmly in layers to fully enjoy the fresh air. As the holiday season approaches, families might take advantage of this pleasant weather to partake in outdoor activities while preparing for upcoming celebrations.",
