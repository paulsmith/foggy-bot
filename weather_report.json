    "weather_report": "As evening envelops Evanston, the air is thick with humidity, creating a damp and muggy atmosphere. The temperature sits comfortably in the mid-60s, with a blustery wind from the south stirring the scene. Currently, the skies are cloudy, hinting at the rain and possible thunderstorms that are forecasted to arrive shortly. Tonight brings an 80% chance of precipitation, with rain expected before 7 PM and heavy showers potentially delivering up to three-quarters of an inch of moisture.\n\nLooking ahead to Tuesday, expect continued cloud cover with thunderstorms likely, as temperatures flirt with the mid-60s before dipping slightly in the afternoon. Winds will be gusty, stirring up the atmosphere and contributing to wave conditions that may be moderately choppy along Lake Michigan. Given these conditions, it's advisable to dress in layers, opting for waterproof attire and sturdy shoes to navigate the wet surroundings. While autumn is setting in with typical temperatures for this time of year, the inclement weather may temper outdoor plans, steering many indoors. However, for those adventurous souls, a brief walk along the beach could still be invigorating, provided one is prepared for the elements.",
