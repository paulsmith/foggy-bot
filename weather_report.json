    "weather_report": "As night settles over Evanston, the temperature is dipping into the low 50s, enveloping the area in a crisp, cool embrace. The air feels slightly humid, with a gentle breeze adding a whisper of chill. Looking east toward Lake Michigan, the scene is painted by mostly cloudy skies, obscuring the starry backdrop, while waves gently lap at the shore, hinting at a restive night ahead. A slight chance of rain looms late, but it seems little more than a drizzle, hardly dampening the overall atmosphere.\n\nTomorrow promises partly sunny skies for the day, with temperatures peaking in the low 50s before sliding back into the high 40s by the afternoon. Wind gusts from the southwest will keep the air feeling fresh, making it a pleasantly cool day for those who venture outdoors. Given the season, these temperatures fit within the typical range for December in the Midwest\u2014cool but not extreme. As for attire, a light jacket or sweater would be advisable, paired with comfortable shoes for a stroll along the beach or through local parks. Activities may include a casual walk admiring the changing shoreline or simply enjoying a hot drink outside, wrapped in the cozy charm of an early winter evening.",
