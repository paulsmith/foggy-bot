    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the weather presents a bleak and murky scene under the cloak of night, with temperatures hovering in the low 50s. The air feels heavy and damp, and visibility is limited due to a thick shroud of fog that whispers across the landscape. Wind remains calm, offering little relief from the impending sense of moisture that blankets the area. As dawn breaks, the forecast points to a continuation of this overcast atmosphere, with morning fog expected to lift only briefly before rain showers roll in. Daytime highs may reach the upper 50s, bolstered by a gentle breeze shifting to the east, increasing the chance of precipitation to 90%.\n\nGiven the chilly, moist conditions, outdoor activities might prove less inviting, particularly with rain on the horizon. Those venturing outside should prepare for dampness, donning layers that include a waterproof jacket or umbrella for the anticipated rain. This time of year, typical for late fall, sees temperatures usually ranging from the upper 40s to low 50s, aligning with seasonal expectations. For anyone considering strolls along the lake or beach activities, it may be best to postpone such plans until clearer skies return. This day also falls outside of any major U.S. holidays, marking a quiet weekend morning in Evanston.",
