    "weather_report": "As the clock ticks into the early hours of November 11 in Evanston, the air is a brisk 52 degrees, accompanied by a notable humidity that lends a dampness to the evening. The wind is howling from the west, a fierce gust that reaches up to 40 miles per hour, making the night feel just a bit cooler. The sky wears a blanket of mostly cloudy conditions, casting a muted glow over the scene along the sandy shores of Lake Michigan, where wave activity is likely elevated with choppy waters lapping against the shore.\n\nLooking ahead to the day on this Veterans Day, the clouds are set to part, giving way to a mostly sunny disposition. Expect temperatures to rise, peaking around the mid-50s before descending to the low 40s in the afternoon. Winds will continue to be blustery, but a little less fierce, blowing steadily at 15 to 20 miles per hour. There\u2019s no precipitation in sight, which offers a pleasant backdrop for outdoor activities. While the scenery may appear moody under a cloudy sky tonight, tomorrow promises a much brighter atmosphere, ideal for a leisurely stroll along the beach or a reflective visit to a nearby park to honor the day. Dress in layers; a light jacket is recommended to fend off the cool breeze. This evening's temperatures are consistent with typical November weather in this region, reminding us that winter's approach is imminent, yet offers a chance to embrace the remaining mild moments of fall.",
