    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current chill of the day is marked by a temperature in the upper 30s, complemented by a robust breeze swirling from the northwest. As the clouds blanket the sky, the atmosphere feels notably brisk and a touch damp, thanks to the elevated moisture in the air. Expect the weather to remain predominantly cloudy throughout today with a high in the mid 40s, only to slide down to the upper 30s tonight. The winds will temper, shifting to a gentle breeze, creating a more manageable outdoor environment later in the day.\n\nThe beach may appear grey and moody, with the waves lapping softly at the shore, but the cooler air suggests that dressing warmly is essential\u2014think layered clothing with a comfortable scarf to shield against the chill. The seasonal temperature is typical for late November in this part of the Midwest, and while there may not be significant precipitation in the immediate future, the overall grey skies might deter leisurely outdoor activities. However, for the adventurous, a brisk walk along the lakeshore could be invigorating, giving a chance to embrace the beauty of Lake Michigan even in its muted winter palette.",
