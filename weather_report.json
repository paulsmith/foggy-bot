    "weather_report": "In Evanston this morning, residents are greeted by a frigid chill, as the temperature hovers in the low single digits. A brisk northwest wind adds to the biting sensation, making it feel as if temperatures have dipped dangerously low, casting a wintry pall over the shoreline. Skies are heavy with clouds, setting a gloomy backdrop, while the beach remains in a lull before the afternoon's forecasted intermittent snow showers. \n\nLooking ahead, today promises sporadic snow showers from 2 PM until late afternoon, with a high struggling to reach the mid-teens. Wind chill could plunge to as low as -9, making outdoor excursions feel especially harsh. Tonight follows suit with more snow chances before seven, leading to a low around 7 degrees as gusty winds will keep the air feeling particularly frosty. The waves on Lake Michigan are likely to be agitated by the gusty conditions, making for a rough surface not suited for leisurely activities. Given the weather, it is advisable for those venturing outside to bundle up in heavy, insulated layers, with hats and gloves as essentials. In this season and region, today's temperatures fall well below typical, emphasizing the need to stay warm. Outdoor plans are best postponed as the weather anticipates a bitter cold experience, rather than an inviting winter day.",
