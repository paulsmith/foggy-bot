    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current scene is defined by mostly cloudy skies with a crisp chill lingering in the air, where temperatures hover in the mid-40s, accompanied by a fierce wind. It's a brisk night, making outdoor activities feel a bit nippy, but there's no precipitation in sight, offering a clear outlook for the rest of the evening. As the night wears on, temperatures are expected to dip, approaching the low 30s, with a parting of the clouds that should allow for a gradual rise in warmth, setting the stage for a milder Sunday.\n\nLooking ahead to the day, Sunday promises a transformation into partly sunny conditions, ideal for venturing outdoors. The temperatures will peak in the low 50s, falling back into the upper 40s as afternoon settles in, accompanied by a gentle breeze. While the probabilities of any unforeseen showers are slim, those planning excursions along Lake Michigan might enjoy cleansing breaths of fresh air, though it's advisable to layer up to counter the cool bite of the fading winds. Given the seasonal context, these conditions align well for early December in this region, where such fluctuations are the hallmark of the waning autumn into winter. Activities like a beach walk or a visit to local parks will be particularly appealing during the sunnier moments of the day.",
