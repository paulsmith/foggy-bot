    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a brisk winter night, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s and a biting northwest wind making it feel even colder. The sky is mostly cloudy, providing a muted backdrop, and despite the stillness of the evening, the wind hints at a wild gustiness off Lake Michigan as it sways the nearby trees. The forecast paints a picture of a chilly night ahead, with temperatures dropping to the mid-teens, accompanied by the possibility of a steady breeze that will add to the winter's chill.\n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, we can expect a shift as the skies clear, revealing mostly sunny conditions that promise to lift spirits. Daytime highs will near the upper 20s, with winds gentler than tonight, which may allow for a more pleasant outdoor experience. Nonetheless, the water conditions remain uninviting, typical for winter along the lake with choppy waves reflecting the robust winds. As for attire, it would be wise to bundle up in layers, donning a warm coat, gloves, and a hat to ward off the cold. Given this is a typical winter day in the Midwest, outdoor activities will be limited; however, a brisk stroll or a warming cup of coffee indoors could be a suitable way to enjoy the day\u2019s unfolding promise of sunshine. For those planning to venture out, it is advisable to prepare for the cold while keeping an eye on the weather, with springlike warmth just a few weeks away.",
