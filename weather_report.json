    "weather_report": "In Evanston this morning, the atmosphere is marked by a cool, cloudy blanket, with temperatures nestled in the low 50s and a humid feel that could make one reach for an extra layer. The winds are brisk, whipping through at nearly 54 miles per hour, lending a certain wildness to the scene along the beach. As the day progresses, rain showers are highly likely, with a forecast high nearing the low 60s before dipping slightly in the afternoon. The forecast predicts these showers will continue into the night, escalating to thunderstorms, so holding onto an umbrella is a wise choice. \n\nThe beach presents a somewhat dreary canvas\u2014clouds looming overhead and waves gently lapping against the shore. The choppy water might excite some surfers, but conditions may not be ideal for casual swimming with the increased wave activity. As for attire, it's advisable to wear layers, incorporating a waterproof jacket for the impending rain and comfortable shoes for walking along the shore\u2014perhaps even an extra pair if you plan to splash about in the shallows. This time of year, the chill is typical for early November around the Great Lakes, setting the stage for a cozy, indoor day filled with warm drinks and good company. With rain forecasted and a significant chill lingering in the air, it might be a perfect opportunity to hunker down with a book or explore nearby cafes rather than venturing out for leisurely outdoor activities.",
