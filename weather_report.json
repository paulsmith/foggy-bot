    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather reveals a cool and dreary atmosphere, with temperatures residing in the mid-40s, under gray skies with a hint of rain in the air. A brisk breeze from the east has stirred the waves of Lake Michigan, contributing to a sense of chill that might dip deeper into the bone when exposed for too long. The beach, usually lively, appears rather subdued today as a blanket of fog lays low, dampening visibility and imparting a somber tone to the shoreline.\n\nAs the day progresses, the forecast calls for persistent rain coupled with patchy fog, keeping those temperatures steady in the mid to upper 40s this evening. The winds will remain gusty, with potential for severe gusts later on, making for quite the blustery experience outdoors. Given the wet conditions and the cold bite in the air, it\u2019s advisable to dress in warm layers and waterproof gear if venturing outside. This weather is typical for late December in the Midwest, when the chill sets in alongside the holiday season. For those considering activities today, perhaps cozying up indoors with a warm beverage or enjoying a local caf\u00e9 would be a more comfortable option than braving the elements along the beach.",
