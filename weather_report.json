    "weather_report": "As of now, Evanston is experiencing a cool and crisp night with temperatures lingering in the low 40s and a noticeable breeze sweeping in from the southeast. The air feels refreshingly brisk, accompanied by a humidity level that brings a touch of dampness but remains manageable. The sky is partly cloudy, creating a somewhat muted ambiance along the beach where the waves are likely rolling gently against the shore, though the stirring wind can make them feel more robust.\n\nLooking ahead to Wednesday, expect mostly cloudy skies with a slight chance of rain in the afternoon. The high will reach the mid 50s, accompanied by a similar southeastern breeze that may pick up slightly in the afternoon. While precipitation is unlikely with only a 20% chance, the overall conditions will still feel a tad damp and chilly. Given the cool temperatures typical for mid-November in this region, dressing in layers will be advisable. A warm jacket, perhaps even a light scarf, would be prudent for anyone venturing outside, particularly with the enticing possibility of softer autumn activities as the season transitions. Ideal options might include a brisk walk along the lakefront or enjoying the quiet beauty of the shoreline as we approach the Thanksgiving season.",
