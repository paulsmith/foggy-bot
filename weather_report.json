    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently experiencing frigid temperatures in the mid-20s, coupled with a damp chill that makes it feel even more biting. The atmosphere is thick with the gaze of heavy snowfall and fog, casting a grey veil over the beachfront vista. Winds howl from the east-northeast at a vigorous pace, adding to the windswept scene and limiting visibility. Moving through the afternoon, the snow will persist relentlessly, with a forecasted high near 30 degrees. Conditions will remain overcast as more snow stirs up, leading to an accumulation of a few inches. This persistent precipitation signifies a day that feels decidedly uninviting, especially along the shoreline where the waves may swell with the wind.\n\nAs temperatures dip tonight to the low teens, a more biting cold will settle in with wind gusts continuing after dusk. The coastal conditions may create a rough, choppy surface on Lake Michigan, not ideal for any water-related activities. For anyone braving the elements, layered clothing suitable for cold, wet weather is advisable\u2014think heavy jackets, warm hats, and preferably waterproof footwear to navigate the icy patches. Given the current season, these temperatures align well with a typical February day in the Midwest, where winter's chill holds sway. Outdoor activities might be limited although cozying up with a good book or indulging in a warm drink indoors would surely enhance the comfort of this wintry Saturday.",
