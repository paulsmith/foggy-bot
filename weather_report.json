    "weather_report": "As darkness falls over Evanston, the current conditions reveal a cool and slightly humid atmosphere, with temperatures lingering in the low 50s, bringing a crispness to the evening air. The south winds are howling at a robust pace, creating a blustery feel that adds a sense of excitement, though the mostly cloudy skies may obscure some of the stars. Tonight, a slight chance of rain showers is anticipated after midnight, with a low settling around the mid-40s. \n\nLooking ahead, Sunday brings a lingering chance of sprinkles before mid-morning, but the day is expected to warm into the high 50s, though temperatures will gradually decline by the afternoon. As for wave conditions on Lake Michigan, the gusty winds could contribute to a choppy surface, making it less ideal for leisurely activities such as swimming or kayaking. Attire should lean towards layers that accommodate the transition from cool to mild\u2014a light jacket combined with long pants will suit the day well. Given the current season and regional climate, these temperatures are typical for mid-November, allowing for a nostalgic embrace of autumn's fading warmth. Activities might include brief beach strolls, a walk in the nearby parks, or cozy gatherings indoors as the holiday season approaches, setting the stage for next week's festivities.",
