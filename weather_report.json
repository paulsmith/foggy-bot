    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston paint a chilly portrait, with temperatures hovering in the mid-20s and brisk winds creating a biting chill. The air feels raw and uninviting, intensified by a strong gustiness that sweeps across the beach. Tonight, expect the unsettling mix of freezing drizzle before dawn, lending a dampened and overcast aura to the evening, with temperatures only dipping to around freezing. The winds will shift to a gentler southern breeze.\n\nTomorrow promises a brighter horizon, as the sun is predicted to break through the clouds, bringing a high nearing the low 40s, though temperatures will begin to taper off by afternoon. Despite the sunnier disposition, the winds will still be quite spirited, with gusts reminiscent of a brisk winter day. Water conditions on Lake Michigan could be unsettled, with the potential for choppy waves, not ideal for recreational activities. Given the current season, these temperatures are typical for February in the Midwest\u2014a time for bundled layers. For outdoor ventures, a warm coat, gloves, and a sturdy hat will be necessary to fend off both the chill and moisture from any expected drizzle. As we are in a non-holiday week, local residents might enjoy a scenic stroll along the shore while dressed appropriately, taking in the beauty that winter brings to Lake Michigan amid the brisk winds and glistening ice.",
