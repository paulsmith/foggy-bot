    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently enveloped in cloudy skies, with temperatures hovering in the low 50s, making for a damp and somewhat chilly ambiance. The brisk north-northwest winds are stirring up the atmosphere, with a noticeable breeze that adds a bite to the air. There\u2019s a hint of impending rain, as isolated showers are expected to drift in later this afternoon, particularly after 4 PM. Tonight, the clouds will linger, and more light rain could sweep through before the evening settles in.\n\nIn terms of enjoyment, the beach may appear inviting but the cool, moist air and potential precipitation lend a rather dreary feel to the day. Wave conditions may be moderate due to the blustery winds, but they are not likely to be tumultuous. As for attire, layering is essential today; a light jacket or fleece is recommended to stave off the chill, paired with waterproof shoes should you venture out to enjoy the beach or park. With the season firmly situated in late fall, these temperatures are typical for this time of year. While indoor activities might be preferable, a brisk walk could be quite refreshing if one welcomes the crisp autumn air\u2014just keep an umbrella handy.",
