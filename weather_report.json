    "weather_report": "The morning in Evanston, Illinois, greets us with a bracing chill, temperatures hovering in the low single digits, complemented by a breezy gust that will liven your senses. Residents may notice a glint of frost on surfaces, as the clear sky allows for a crisp start to the day. These conditions are shaping up to give way to partly sunny skies, promising a slight warming as temperatures inch toward the upper 20s by midday. Though wind chill will still tug at exposed skin, making it feel as though it's near zero, the northeast breeze whispers gently and offers most a refreshing touch amidst the winter landscape.\n\nAs the day progresses, expect a gradual transition to mostly cloudy skies this evening, with temperatures maintaining a steady course into the low 30s overnight. The waves on Lake Michigan are predicted to remain fairly calm, perfect for contemplative walks along the shoreline or simply enjoying the serene winter scene. Precipitation does not seem to be a concern today; however, as the season unfolds, layers become essential attire, making cozy hats, gloves, and insulated jackets necessary to fend off the cold. This time of year is quintessentially winter for the Midwest, with temperatures aligning quite typically for December. Engage with the outdoors by taking brisk walks, embracing this chilly snapshot before the winter solstice, or perhaps visiting local cafes to warm up with a hot drink.",
