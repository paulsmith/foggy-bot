    "weather_report": "Current weather conditions in Evanston present a chilly scene. As the temperature rests in the low 40s, the air carries a brisk chill, complemented by an overcast sky. With winds howling at nearly 58 miles per hour, the outdoor environment feels quite blustery, creating a stark contrast against the stillness of the dark waters of Lake Michigan. There is currently no precipitation, but the forecast suggests a chance of scattered rain showers later tonight, giving way to a partially cloudy evening as temperatures dip towards the mid-30s.\n\nAs we look ahead to the day, expect partly sunny skies with a high creeping up to around the mid-50s, though likely dropping back into the 40s by afternoon. This day would be best suited for bundling up in layers, perhaps favoring a warm jacket and a hat, given the wind chill and impending moisture in the air. While today isn't a major holiday, its unfriendly chill may steer most away from outdoor activities, except for a vigorous walk along the lakeshore, where the sound of crashing waves could provide a refreshing backdrop. The conditions reflect a typical late winter day in Illinois, hinting at the promise of spring, even as the remnants of winter still linger in the air.",
