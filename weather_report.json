    "weather_report": "Evanston currently finds itself enshrouded in a chilly embrace, where temperatures hover in the mid-30s, creating a brisk atmosphere punctuated by light snow. The wind whips in from the west at a fierce pace, adding a biting edge to the air. As evening falls, the clouds remain thick, and for tonight, scattered snow showers are anticipated. The mercury is expected to dip further, landing around the low 30s, with blustery winds continuing to shape the night.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, significant snowfall is projected before the noon hour, shifting to a mix of rain and snow during the day. Expect the high to flirt with the mid-40s, but with winds howling at over 20 mph, it will feel considerably colder. The chance of precipitation is at an all-time high, suggesting new snow accumulations of 1 to 3 inches could blanket the already wintry landscape. The scene might not be the most inviting for outdoor activities, especially with wave conditions likely to be tumultuous along the lakeshore. Given the current season, these temperatures are typical for November in the Midwest, inviting layers for warmth. For those venturing outside, bundling up with sturdy coats, thick scarves, and weatherproof boots should help to stave off the cold. As we navigate this wintry evening, keep in mind that Thanksgiving is just a few days away, a reminder of warmth and togetherness amidst the winter chill.",
