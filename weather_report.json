    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois, paint a picture of a drizzly, unsettled night with temperatures lingering in the low 50s. The air is thick with moisture, making it feel relatively cool and damp. Wind gusts are brisk, ruffling leaves and creating an energetic atmosphere along the lakeshore. As we look ahead to the day, cloud cover will dominate the sky, with a potential for more light drizzle and a slight chance of rain preceding dawn. Daytime temperatures will peak in the low 50s before settling back into the upper 40s by afternoon, and those southwest breezes will persist.\n\nFor those contemplating outdoor activities, the weather may not be particularly inviting; the beach will be quiet, perhaps best suited for a brisk walk or contemplation near the water, where wave conditions can be moderate to choppy with the ongoing winds. Recommended attire includes a light rain jacket and layers to ward off the chill, making it essential for comfort throughout the day. While this time of year typically signals the onset of deeper winter temperatures, tonight\u2019s conditions may feel a touch warmer than usual. As it is December 9th, with no major holidays celebrated today, it\u2019s a good time to prepare for the festive season ahead.",
