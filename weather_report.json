    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston are characterized by a chilly atmosphere, with temperatures in the mid-30s complemented by a thick cloak of fog and mist. The air feels damp as a gentle breeze whispers in from the southeast at roughly 12 mph, making for a distinctly cool start to the day. As you step outside, expect limited visibility due to the fog, lending an ethereal quality to the surroundings, especially along the beach.\n\nAs the day unfolds, patchy fog should lift, giving way to clouds and a high reaching into the low 40s. Afternoon hours will bring a gradual coolness as temperatures fall back into the upper 30s. Tonight, the weather will turn mostly cloudy with cooler conditions settling in, leading to lows around the mid-20s. The winds are expected to remain brisk, with gusts hitting 30 mph, creating a somewhat blustery evening. While no significant precipitation is in the forecast, the wave conditions on Lake Michigan may churn, given the wind's intensity, though they are unlikely to reach hazardous levels. For those venturing outdoors today, layering up is advisable\u2014think warm jackets and perhaps a hat or scarf, especially as the evening approaches. \n\nIn this chilly early February season, temperatures are typical for the region but can feel colder due to the wind and moisture in the air. Outdoor activities might be limited; however, a brisk walk along the shoreline could be invigorating if one is properly dressed against the elements.",
