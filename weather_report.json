    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather presents a brisk scene with temperatures hovering in the low 20s, under cloudy skies. The air feels notably chilly, with a ferocious wind stirring up from the north at a fierce pace, making outdoor activities feel even colder than the temperature gauges suggest. As we look toward the horizon from the beach, the waves, stirred by the gusty winds, create a restless surface on Lake Michigan, hinting at the potential for snow flurries later in the night.\n\nLooking ahead, the forecast indicates a steady drop to a low near the upper 20s, accompanied by a 50% chance of light snow accumulation\u2014less than half an inch expected overnight. Tomorrow, snow is in the forecast with an 80% likelihood, and significant accumulation could bring 2 to 4 inches. This is typical for this season, where northern Illinois often experiences unpredictable winter weather, but it also encourages cozy activities indoors. Given these conditions, dressing in warm, layered clothing would be prudent if venturing outside. With winter firmly in place, the landscape offers a striking yet subdued beauty, perfect for those inclined to take in the snowy vistas\u2014perhaps with a warm drink in hand.",
