    "weather_report": "Evanston is experiencing a cloudy afternoon with brisk temperatures in the upper 50s, complemented by a noticeable dampness in the air that hints at the rain showers expected later in the day. The wind is quite gusty, adding a wind-chill factor to the overall feel. As we look ahead, rain showers are likely, with a substantial chance for downpours and possibly thunderstorms tonight. Residents can expect temperatures to remain steady, rising slightly into the low 60s overnight. Given these conditions, the beach might appear less inviting, with choppy waters and looming clouds casting a somewhat dreary ambiance over Lake Michigan.\n\nFor those venturing outside, it\u2019s advisable to wear a light jacket or raincoat, as precipitation is imminent and the winds could feel sharp. With the chance of rain and the current autumn atmosphere, outdoor activities may need to be reconsidered in favor of cozying up indoors with a good book or enjoying a leisurely cup of coffee at a local caf\u00e9. This evening\u2019s stormy forecast makes for perfect conditions to settle in and watch the rain from the comfort of home.",
