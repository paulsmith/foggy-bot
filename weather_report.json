    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the night air carries a chill, with temperatures hovering in the low 50s and a humid feel that leaves a dampness in the atmosphere. The wind is howling from the west at a brisk pace, creating a lively and restless sound along the shoreline. Currently, the sky is mostly cloudy, offering a patchy view of the moon, while wave action on Lake Michigan creates a restless surface, reflecting the vibrant dance of wind against water. As we look toward the forecast, it's indicated that the overnight conditions will remain mostly cloudy, with temperatures inching up slightly as the night wears on. Tomorrow, however, brings promising weather with mostly sunny skies expected, a high near the mid-50s, and a drop in temperature in the afternoon, accompanied by a blustery wind.\n\nTomorrow marks Veterans Day, a fitting occasion for outdoor honors and gatherings. However, the waves may still be too rough for swimming, making it best to admire the lake from afar. Recommended attire would include layers, with a jacket wise to bring along to combat the breeze as temperatures fluctuate throughout the day. While it\u2019s a cooler time of year in this part of the Midwest, conditions today feel typical for November, where crispness reigns and transitions to winter begin to set in. With the promise of clearer skies by mid-morning, it\u2019s an inviting opportunity for walks along the beach, visiting local caf\u00e9s, or participating in community events that honor our veterans.",
