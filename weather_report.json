    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reflect a chilly scene, with temperatures hovering in the mid-teens and a brisk wind providing a sharp bite. The air feels considerably cold, accentuated by a robust breeze, making it advisable to bundle up in warm layers if venturing outdoors. The night is mostly clear, offering a glimpse of bright stars above, although the beach remains tranquil and serene, shrouded in the quiet of the evening.\n\nLooking ahead, the weather forecast promises a transition to pleasant sunshine tomorrow, with high temperatures reaching the upper 20s. Winds will remain gentle, creating a more comfortable atmosphere as the daylight unfolds. As for wave conditions, they are likely calm given the current stillness around the lake. There is no precipitation expected for the day ahead, allowing for outdoor activities to be enjoyed without the worry of getting caught in the rain. It\u2019s a fine time for a winter walk along the beach or engaging in a brisk jog, just be sure to dress warmly due to the lingering chill of the season. As we step into December, these temperatures are indeed consistent with typical winter conditions across the region.",
