    "weather_report": "In Evanston, current conditions present a chilly scene with the temperature hovering just above 20 degrees, complemented by a brisk, howling wind from the west that adds to the bite in the air. The sky remains mostly cloudy, giving an indication of the winter season's starkness, making it feel a bit dreary despite the beauty of Lake Michigan in the distance. As we look ahead, the day promises a transition to mostly sunny skies with a high near the low 30s, though temperatures will begin to dip as the afternoon progresses, creating a contrast between the early warmth of sunshine and the coolness of the season. Tonight, expect the clouds to thicken again as temperatures settle around 26 degrees, accompanied by a gusty southwest wind that may stir up the lake.\n\nWave conditions on the lake might be moderate, which could be inviting for some brisk beachside walks, though caution is advised if venturing closer to the water. There\u2019s no precipitation forecasted now or later today, making it a dry day to enjoy outdoor activities if bundled properly. Given the chill, dressing warmly in layers, with hats and gloves, is recommended to stay comfortable during any outdoor excursions. The temperatures are typical for early December in this region, perfectly fitting for the transition to winter. Ideal activities might include visiting local cafes or enjoying a winter stroll, soaking in the holiday preparations around town, even as we head into a new week, with no major holidays looming just yet.",
