    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois, present a dreary scene, with temperatures hovering in the mid 30s and a persistent light rain accompanied by fog and mist, creating a somber ambiance. The air is heavy with moisture, making it feel chilly and a bit uncomfortable outside. Winds are howling from the southeast, intensifying the dampness and potentially leading to rough wave conditions along Lake Michigan.\n\nAs we look toward the forecast, expect a continuation of rain this evening before midnight, transitioning into drizzle and fog through the early morning. The temperatures are anticipated to rise slightly overnight, reaching the low 40s, still falling within the typical chill of December in this region. Saturday will bring areas of drizzle and fog lingering until the afternoon, with overcast skies and a high near 43, but with a lowered chance of additional precipitation.\n\nGiven these conditions, it would be wise to dress warmly in layers, opting for waterproof attire to stay dry amidst the rain and humidity. The beaches may not be the ideal destination for outdoor activities, but a cozy day indoors with a good book or movie beckons, as the upcoming holiday festivities loom. Keep an eye out for gusty winds and the potential for turbulent waters if venturing anywhere close to the lake.",
