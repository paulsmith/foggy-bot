    "weather_report": "Conditions in Evanston are fittingly brisk for December, with a temperature resting in the upper 20s and a damp chill accentuated by a fierce breeze skimming from the west-southwest. The skies are overcast, offering a muted light that casts a grayish hue across the beach and Lake Michigan. As the day progresses, temperatures are expected to peak around the low 30s before dipping again into the mid-20s in the afternoon, accompanied by gusty winds reaching up to 40 mph, making the air feel significantly colder, with wind chill values plummeting near zero as night approaches.\n\nToday, scattered snow showers are on the agenda, particularly in the early afternoon, with a modest chance of light accumulation. The beach will likely not see significant wave action due to the prevailing wind direction and strength, which may stir the water somewhat but not enough to create notable surf. A warm coat, hat, and gloves will be necessary attire for anyone planning to venture outdoors, as conditions will feel uncomfortably cold, especially during the gusts. With winter solstice just around the corner, these temperatures are entirely expected for this time of year in the Great Lakes region. Ideal activities today might include visiting a cozy caf\u00e9 or indulging in some winter shopping, while outdoor enthusiasts should consider bundling up for a brisk walk along the shoreline to witness the winter scenery, despite the chilling air.",
