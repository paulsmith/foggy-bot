    "weather_report": "In Evanston, current conditions paint a picture of a cool, slightly breezy evening along the shores of Lake Michigan, with temperatures nestled in the mid 40s. The air carries a crispness, enhanced by a gentle humidity that keeps the atmosphere comfortable yet invigorating. Skies are mostly clear, allowing for occasional glimpses of stars above, though a soft blanket of clouds is anticipated to gather as the night progresses. \n\nLooking ahead, the weather forecast suggests a shift to a mostly cloudy day tomorrow, with a high in the mid 50s and a slight chance of rain in the afternoon, particularly after 3 PM. Winds will continue to be gentle but gusty, creating a bit of movement on the water that may whip up some larger waves. Given these conditions, beachgoers should dress in layers to accommodate the cooler temperatures and potential dampness later in the day. While the season brings about typical mid-autumn chills, tomorrow\u2019s conditions invite a leisurely stroll along the beach or a visit to local cafes to savor the neighborhood\u2019s vibrant atmosphere before the onset of precipitation.",
