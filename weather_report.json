    "weather_report": "In Evanston, current conditions are quite crisp, with the temperature hovering in the mid-teens and a blustery wind adding to the chill. The sky is mostly clear, making for a serene but frigid atmosphere as we transition into the early hours of the morning. As the sun prepares to rise, expect the clouds to roll in overnight, bringing a low around 18 degrees accompanied by a gentle breeze from the west-northwest. Monday will see temperatures rise slightly, peaking near 30 before settling into the upper 20s. A slight chance of snow showers looms, though significant accumulation isn't anticipated.\n\nCurrently, the beach scene reflects calmness under starlit skies, but as clouds gather, the tranquility may give way to a more foreboding atmosphere. Wave conditions on Lake Michigan are likely to remain moderate, given the breezy conditions; be mindful if venturing out, as the waves can catch you off guard. Given the temperatures, it's advisable to bundle up with a warm coat, gloves, and a hat to shield against the biting wind. The seasonal chill is typical for early December in the Midwest, though the impending snow could provide a picturesque winter setting perfect for light outdoor activities or cozy indoor pursuits. While today may not be festive in a major holiday sense, it brings a calm respite before the holiday season picks up momentum in the coming weeks.",
