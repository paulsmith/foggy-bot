    "weather_report": "Evanston is waking up to some decidedly dreary weather this morning, with temperatures hovering in the low 40s and a persistent mist giving the landscape a muted, foggy appearance. The air feels damp and heavy, making for an uncomfortably chilly ambience, particularly with the breeze whispering in from the south at around 20 miles per hour. As the day unfolds, expect areas of fog and patchy drizzle to linger, with a likely high near the mid-40s. Tonight, conditions will remain overcast, with the possibility of light rain showers and more fog, as temperatures settle around the low 40s, possibly rising later in the night.\n\nGiven these conditions, the water of Lake Michigan may be choppy but should not be excessively turbulent. The patchy fog significantly reduces visibility, creating an uninviting tableau for outdoor excursions. For those venturing outside, layered clothing is advised to combat the chill and dampness, favoring a light waterproof jacket to stave off any unexpected drizzles. While the season mandates a certain coolness, today's weather feels unusually bleak, aligning with the atmospheric trends of mid-December. Any outdoor activities should preferably be kept light, perhaps a stroll along the shore for those with a taste for the eerie beauty of a fog-laden landscape, but keep an eye on the darkening skies.",
