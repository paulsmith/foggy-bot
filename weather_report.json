    "weather_report": "As night settles over Evanston, the current conditions reflect a biting chill, with temperatures hovering in the low 10s and a brisk westerly wind, creating a sharp wind chill that plunges it closer to the negative. The skies are mostly clear, providing a stark contrast to the frost-kissed landscape along Lake Michigan. Tonight will maintain this clear demeanor, with lows dipping down to around 1 degree, but a slight warming trend through the night will see temperatures rise slightly, avoiding the bitter extremes.\n\nLooking ahead to Friday, residents can expect mostly sunny skies with highs approaching the low 20s. However, caution is advised as wind chill factors could make it feel as frigid as -8. The beach scene, although picturesque with its shimmering, icy coastline under a clear sky, is not inviting for the faint of heart. Those enjoying outdoor activities may find them bracing yet invigorating, provided they bundle up appropriately in warm layers, hats, and gloves. Tread carefully if venturing to the beach, as the waterfront will be particularly wild with the breeze stirring up the lake. In this winter season, temperatures are indeed typical for January in this region, and while tomorrow's sun may seem inviting, the underlying chill will remind everyone it\u2019s still winter in the Midwest.",
