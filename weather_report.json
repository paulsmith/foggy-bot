    "weather_report": "This morning in Evanston, we find ourselves in the midst of winter\u2019s embrace, with a brisk atmosphere gripped by temperatures in the low 30s, complemented by a veil of light snow. The air carries a biting chill, further accentuated by fierce winds, sweeping across the landscape and bringing with them the promise of more snow throughout the day. As the skies remain overcast, the forecast predicts a transition to a mix of rain and snow by noon, with a high creeping toward the low 40s. Accumulations of two to four inches are anticipated, as gusty northwest winds continue to howl, making outdoor conditions feel particularly raw and uninviting. \n\nWith the shifting weather patterns, the beach may appear somber and windswept rather than inviting, with the waves likely heightened by the blustery conditions near Lake Michigan. For those braving the elements, layering is essential; a warm coat, sturdy boots, and a hat would be wise to fend off the stinging cold. As it is mid-November, these temperatures are typical for this time of year in the Midwest, casting a distinctly wintry feel to the season. Given the conditions, it may be best to plan for cozy indoor activities, perhaps revisiting holiday preparations or enjoying a warm beverage as the storm rolls in.",
