    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather presents a brisk scene, with temperatures hovering in the low 20s and a blustery wind slicing through the air at a notable pace. The atmosphere feels quite cool, thanks to a significant chill which is accentuated by moisture lingering in the air. As the night unfolds, the sky will become partly cloudy, allowing for a hint of starlight amidst the cold\u2014a low dipping toward the teens will lend a stark winter chill to the air.\n\nLooking ahead to Saturday, residents can expect mostly sunny skies, a welcome sight after the recent clouds and chill. Highs will reach into the mid 20s before settling back into the low 20s in the afternoon. While wind speeds will moderate to a gentle breeze, the lakefront may still experience some spirited wave action, making it less than ideal for casual strolls along the beach. Dress warmly, ideally layering with thick winter clothing and accessories such as gloves and scarves, as the temperature feels distinctly wintry. These conditions reflect typical seasonal expectations for December in this region, where the cold comes hand in hand with the onset of winter festivities. \n\nWith no significant precipitation in sight, outdoor enthusiasts might find enjoyment in winter activities like ice skating or even a brisk walk in the quieter parks. However, given the chill, one should bundle up well to fully appreciate the beauty of the snowy landscape without discomfort.",
