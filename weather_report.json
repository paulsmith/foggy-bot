    "weather_report": "The weather in Evanston, Illinois, is decidedly brisk tonight, with temperatures resting in the mid 20s under a canopy of clouds. A gusty wind from the east-southeast adds a biting chill, making it feel even cooler. As the night unfolds, the forecast predicts a slight rise in temperature to around the upper 20s, with winds remaining blustery, potentially reaching gusts of 30 mph. \n\nLooking ahead to Saturday, the day is expected to begin under cloudy skies, setting the stage for a probable shift to rain later in the afternoon, particularly after 3 PM. With temperatures climbing to the upper 30s, conditions will remain relatively gloomy, and the chance of precipitation stands at 60%. Those planning to venture outdoors should prepare for wet weather; the lake waves may be choppy, reflecting the wind's strong presence. Dressing in layers, along with a waterproof jacket and footwear, will help combat the cool air and anticipate rain. As December progresses, the temperatures align with the season's typical chill here in the Midwest, where the onset of winter is marked by such conditions. Given the dreary outlook, indoor activities like visiting local cafes or warming up at home may be more appealing than braving the blustery beach on a December weekend.",
