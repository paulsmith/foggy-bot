    "weather_report": "In Evanston today, the air is crisp and cool, with current temperatures hovering in the mid-20s. The scene is mostly clear, allowing sunlight to reflect off the glistening surface of Lake Michigan, creating a serene atmosphere at the beach. Wind gusts are howling across the shoreline at a notable speed, making it feel even chillier, especially as we head into the afternoon. While no precipitation is expected, the air is refreshingly dry, making it a pleasant day for those bundled up appropriately. \n\nLooking ahead, temperatures will peak near the upper 20s before settling back into the lower 20s tonight. The evening promises partly cloudy skies with a gentle breeze easing into the night. Given the season, these conditions are typical for early December in the Midwest, where cool air and brisk winds mark the landscape. A warm coat, perhaps accompanied by a hat and gloves, would be advisable for those venturing outdoors. The stunning clarity of the day invites a stroll along the waterfront or a brisk walk in nearby parks, capturing this fleeting beauty before winter settles in fully.",
