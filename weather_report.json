    "weather_report": "As we delve into the weather conditions in Evanston tonight, we find ourselves nestled in a crisp and cool atmosphere with the temperature hovering in the low 20s, accompanied by a gentle breeze that stirs the air. Currently clear skies stretch over the landscape, allowing for sharp visibility of the moonlit beach scene along Lake Michigan. As we look forward to Sunday, the forecast promises a mostly sunny day with a high reaching into the upper 20s. However, it's worth noting that the wind chill will be biting, dropping the perceived temperature down to near zero at times, as the brisk west-northwest winds gust up to 20 miles per hour.\n\nThe tranquility of the night gives way to potential wave activity by the morning, making the beach a stage for the wind's performance against the water. With no precipitation in sight, the dry conditions add to the overall clarity and serenity of the evening. Recommended attire for venturing outdoors includes layered clothing to combat the cold and wind, featuring insulated jackets, hats, and gloves for comfort. This chilly weather is typical for early December in this midwestern region, reflecting the season\u2019s character as we approach the holiday festivities. Given the conditions, outdoor enthusiasts may find brisk walks along the lakefront invigorating, while others may prefer the comfort of cozy indoor pursuits as the holiday season draws ever closer.",
