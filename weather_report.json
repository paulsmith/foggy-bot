    "weather_report": "As evening settles in Evanston, the temperature sits comfortably in the low 50s, enveloped in a humid atmosphere that feels noticeably damp. The winds are brisk, stirring up a rather blustery environment, while the skies are mostly cloudy, casting a grayed hue over the landscape. Tonight, expect rain showers before the early morning hours, bringing a drizzly close to the day with a high chance of precipitation. While only minimal rainfall is anticipated, gusts of wind could reach up to 25 mph, adding to the chill in the air.\n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, the weather will begin with some patchy drizzle with a hopeful transition to partly sunny skies by afternoon. Temperatures are forecasted to rise to a high near 60 before dipping slightly in the later hours, providing a moderately pleasant day overall. Given the seasonal transition, these temperatures are fairly typical for November in the Midwest. A light jacket or sweater would be wise attire, especially for any outdoor excursions, as the wind may still have a chill. The wave conditions along Lake Michigan will likely be moderate, suitable for a brief beach visit or a stroll along the shore; however, it\u2019s best to stay aware of the weather, as the potential for rain could spur a retreat indoors.",
