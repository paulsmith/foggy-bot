    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the air is crisp and cool this morning, with temperatures hovering in the mid-20s, complemented by a stiff southerly breeze that adds a biting edge to the day. The sky is draped in a thick layer of clouds, offering little respite from the chill. As we look ahead, the forecast suggests a chance of snow early this afternoon, giving way to a mix of rain and snow later on. Highs will climb to near the mid-30s, but with the wind picking up, the wind chill may keep things feeling even colder. \n\nWith wave conditions likely to be moderate, the lake may appear somewhat agitated, but conditions are generally calm for a winter day on the shore. Layers are essential today; a warm jacket, hat, and gloves are highly recommended to fend off the nippy breeze. While the season brings its typical chill, the impending precipitation might create a slightly gloomy atmosphere, making sheltered indoor activities more appealing. With the approach of the holiday season, it's a good day to cozy up with a warm drink indoors or prepare for festive gatherings, as the last-minute rush of the season blooms in anticipation of the upcoming celebrations.",
