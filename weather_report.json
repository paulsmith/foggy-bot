    "weather_report": "A chilly morning in Evanston brings temperatures hovering in the mid-20s, under partly cloudy skies and a brisk, wild wind from the southwest that adds a sharp bite to the air. As the day unfolds, expect some scattered rain and snow showers after mid-afternoon, with a high reaching into the upper 30s. The day will be mostly cloudy with the wind continuing to howl at around 20 to 25 mph, with gusts possibly exceeding 50 mph. As evening sets in, the snow showers will linger until about 10 PM, potentially leaving a light dusting on the ground.\n\nGiven these conditions, the landscape may appear uninviting, with grey clouds looming overhead and the Lake Michigan shoreline experiencing moderate waves that could deter most from a relaxing stroll by the water. The wind chill will bring temperatures down significantly, so dressing warmly in layers is advisable, with hats and gloves recommended to fend off the cold. This time of year in the Midwest often brings such brisk weather, so one can expect today\u2019s chill to be typical for early December. While outdoor activities may be limited due to the elements, those undeterred could enjoy a vigorous walk or a quick jog, finding a certain quiet beauty in the winter's icy grip.",
