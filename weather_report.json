    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston paint a chilly picture, with temperatures hovering in the low 20s amidst brisk, howling winds. The air carries a biting edge, making it feel even cooler, and the sky is cloaked in clouds, hinting at the possibility of scattered snow showers tonight. As the day transitions, the forecast suggests a shift to partly sunny skies tomorrow, with temperatures rising to the mid 30s\u2014an expected but gradual warming as the day unfolds.\n\nThe beach, usually vibrant, takes on a more subdued and wintry vibe under these conditions. Wave activity along Lake Michigan may be somewhat restless, influenced by the gusty winds but not exceptionally harmful. For those venturing outdoors, a warm coat, gloves, and a hat are strongly advised to combat the frosty air. The temperature feels representative of a typical January in the Midwest, although slightly cooler than average, reminding us that winter holds its grip firmly still. Given the season and temperature, outdoor excursions might be best suited for brisk walks or perhaps a quick visit to enjoy the scenic winter landscape; however, staying cozy indoors with a cup of something warm could prove even more tempting on this cold night.",
