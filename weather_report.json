    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently enveloped in a chilly embrace as temperatures hover in the mid-30s, complemented by a comfortable yet damp air that gives a sense of winter's persistent hold. Light snow and fog create a dim, almost ethereal atmosphere, obscuring visibility and rendering the landscape a muted canvas of white and gray. As we look ahead, an overnight forecast promises more snow and a chance for drizzle, with temperatures expected to dip slightly, rising only to around the low 30s by the overnight hours. The winds will shift from the east southeast, becoming more blustery at 5 to 15 mph, occasionally gusting as high as 25 mph, adding a sharp bite to the already cool conditions.\n\nTomorrow, the snow will continue, particularly in the morning, yielding to snow showers through the day. Daytime temperatures will struggle to reach the mid-30s before dipping once again, combined with a brisk north wind that may howl at 20 to 25 mph, creating formidable wind chills. The likelihood of precipitation remains high, with expected snowfall amounts possibly reaching accretions of less than an inch. These conditions suggest a winter day that lacks the warmth or allure for outdoor enjoyment. For those venturing out, layers are advisable, ideally including a warm coat, hat, and sturdy boots\u2014essential gear for navigating the slick and snowy terrain. Overall, this wintry weather is more akin to the heart of the season, reminding us that winter is still in command on this December day.",
