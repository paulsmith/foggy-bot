    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the evening brings a cool, crisp atmosphere as temperatures hover in the low 40s with a gentle breeze stirring from the north. The sky is mostly cloudy, setting a rather somber tone as we look toward Lake Michigan. As night falls, scattered rain showers are anticipated, particularly between 9 PM and 3 AM, with a 40% chance of precipitation, but little accumulation is expected. \n\nThanksgiving Day promises mostly sunny skies with temperatures rising briefly to the mid-30s before tapering off in the afternoon. As for the waves, the lake's conditions are likely to be moderate, though any activities on the water may be curtailed by the incoming chill and wind gusts reaching 25 mph. Given the chilly weather, it's best to dress warmly in layers with a sturdy jacket and perhaps a hat to fend off the evening's bite. While the season certainly embraces these cooler temperatures typical for late November in the Midwest, outdoor plans may be best suited for a cozy evening indoors rather than prolonged exposure to the brisk elements.",
