    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois reveal a stark, damp atmosphere marked by light rain and fog, with temperatures lingering in the mid-50s. The air feels uncomfortably humid, and a strong, gusty wind sweeps in from the southeast at a brisk pace, causing the waves on Lake Michigan to rise and crash more energetically against the shore. As the afternoon progresses, expect the cloudy skies to persist along with rain showers becoming more frequent, with temperatures dipping slightly to around 55. This evening carries a 100% likelihood of rain, accompanied by strong winds that could gust up to 40 mph, contributing to a sense of wildness in the air.\n\nGiven these conditions, it\u2019s advisable to dress warmly in waterproof clothing if venturing outdoors, particularly if a walk along the beach is planned. The temperature, while typical for November in this region, feels cooler due to the wind and dampness in the air. The surge in wind and rain may not encourage outdoor activities, so consider indoor pastimes instead\u2014visiting local caf\u00e9s or engaging in community events could bring comfort out of the stormy weather. While it\u2019s not a holiday today, the upcoming days may offer brighter opportunities for enjoying the season more fully.",
