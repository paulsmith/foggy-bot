    "weather_report": "As evening falls over Evanston, the air is enveloped in a damp chill, typical for this time of year as autumn transitions into winter. Current conditions reveal a temperature hovering in the low 50s, accompanied by a notable humidity that lends a heavy feel to the air. The sky is mostly cloudy, casting a muted light over the landscape as gusty winds blow in from the southeast, making the atmosphere feel brisker than it actually is. As for precipitation, expect rain showers to spread across the region late into the night, bringing the promise of a drizzly atmosphere before dawn.\n\nLooking ahead, tomorrow's weather offers a mix of light drizzle in the morning, transitioning into a tentative chance of sun by midday, albeit with temperatures peaking around the upper 50s before dropping again in the afternoon. The winds will continue to be breezy, with gusts that could whip up a bit of energy along the shore of Lake Michigan. This might make for less than ideal wave conditions, as choppy waters are likely, preventing most from finding solace along the beach. In light of these trends, dress warmly in layers, opting for waterproof attire if venturing outside, especially later in the evening. Despite the dampness, opportunities abound for enjoying indoor activities with friends or family, or perhaps even a cozy evening walk under the freshly draped evening sky.",
