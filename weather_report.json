    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current scene is marked by a cool, damp night with a temperature in the low 50s, creating an atmosphere that feels both fresh and humid. The wind is gently whispering from the north, a reminder of the autumn chill that lingers as clouds blanket the sky. As dawn approaches, residents can expect a continuation of this cloudy weather overnight, with temperatures dropping slightly to a low near 46, while a light breeze holds steady. \n\nThe forecast for Thursday reveals a promising shift toward clearer skies, as the sun is expected to emerge, pushing afternoon temperatures to the mid to upper 50s. While wave conditions in Lake Michigan may be moderately choppy due to the current wind patterns, the overall outlook for the day is more pleasant, inviting outdoor activities such as crisp walks along the beach or visits to nearby parks. While no precipitation appears imminent for the upcoming hours, it's advisable to don layers\u2014perhaps a light jacket over a sweater\u2014to stay comfortable in the transition between the brisk morning air and the hoped-for afternoon warmth. As the weather aligns with typical seasonal expectations for this time of year in the Midwest, it presents a wonderful opportunity to enjoy the beauty of autumn in Evanston.",
