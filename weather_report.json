    "weather_report": "Evanston, Illinois, is currently under a blanket of clouds, creating a chilly ambiance as temperatures hover in the low 40s, complemented by a brisk northwesterly wind that feels quite gusty. The air carries a somewhat damp chill, making it feel colder than the numbers suggest. Presently, there are no signs of precipitation, but the grey skies loom overhead with an intensity that suggests a potential shift. As we look forward, tonight's forecast predicts continued cloud cover with a low around the upper 30s, as the winds taper off to a gentler 10 to 15 mph.\n\nThroughout Saturday, expect a mostly cloudy day with afternoon temperatures dipping towards the low 40s. While the air may not be quite comfortable, it does not offer any major discomfort either\u2014just that persistent chill typical of this time of year along the lake. With waves likely becoming a bit choppy due to the wind, it may not be the best day for beachcombing, but bundled-up walks along the shoreline could still be enjoyable. Dress warmly in layers to fend off the cold, and consider waterproof footwear in case of any lingering dampness from the beach. As we find ourselves in late November, these temperatures align closely with expectations for the season, marking it as a typical autumn day in the Midwest.",
