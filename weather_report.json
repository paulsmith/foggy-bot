    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Evanston, the weather is characterized by a prevailing gloom, with temperatures hovering in the mid-50s and a relentless drizzle reducing visibility. The air is thick and damp, making for a rather uninviting outdoor experience. Currently, strong winds are gripping the area, contributing to a chilled atmosphere, further deepened by the onset of rain and fog. Looking ahead, the gloomy conditions are expected to persist, with steady rain throughout the evening, and temperatures dipping slightly, settling at around the mid-50s.\n\nFor those contemplating outdoor activities, it's advisable to postpone plans in favor of a cozy afternoon indoors, perhaps enjoying a warm drink while watching the rain dance against the windows. With wave activity likely to be choppy and unwelcoming, beach excursions should also be avoided. Dress warmly and waterproof if venture outside, as the gusts will intensify, potentially reaching gale-force speeds later in the day. Currently within late autumn, these conditions are typical for Evanston as it transitions into winter, showcasing the region's signature chilly and damp fall weather.",
