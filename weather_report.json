    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather is marked by a cool and damp atmosphere, with the temperature hovering in the low 50s and humidity creating a heavy, moist sensation in the air. Blustery winds from the southeast add an edge to the rain and mist, painting a rather grey picture at the beach, where visibility is low and the waves churn restlessly against the shore. Indeed, light rain is currently falling, and expectations are set for this precipitation to continue through the night, signaling a 100% chance of additional showers until the early morning hours.\n\nAs Sunday approaches, expect a slight reprieve from the heavier downpours, with patchy drizzle lingering until around mid-morning, followed by more scattered rain showers throughout the day. Partly sunny skies should begin to emerge later on, though temperatures will only reach the high 50s, cooling down again by the afternoon. While the brisk, gusty winds will likely make it feel a touch cooler, a light jacket will be necessary for comfort when venturing outside. The current season makes these temperatures typical for November; however, the overall dreary conditions may not inspire much outdoor activity. Still, for those eager to embrace the elements, a brisk walk along the misty beach or a cozy afternoon at a local caf\u00e9 could provide a pleasant refuge from the chill.",
