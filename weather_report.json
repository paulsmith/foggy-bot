    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather paints a picture of a brisk winter day, with temperatures in the low 40s and a noticeable chill due to a fierce breeze from the northwest. The mostly cloudy skies provide a muted light, but perceptibly no precipitation is expected today. As the afternoon progresses, we will see a transition to sunnier conditions with temperatures gradually falling to around the upper 30s, accompanied by gusty winds. Tonight, the skies should remain mostly clear, dipping to the low 30s by morning, making for a crisp evening.\n\nGiven the current weather, it's vital to dress warmly, favoring layers that allow for some insulation against the biting wind. A cozy jacket, scarf, and sturdy shoes would be advisable for anyone venturing outdoors. As for outdoor activities, this afternoon's clearer skies might entice locals to take a stroll along the beach, albeit bundled up against the cold. Just keep in mind that this time of year, such temperatures align with the typical winter conditions one expects in Illinois, with a landscape still graced by remnants of snow. As we consider the forthcoming Valentine's holiday, take a moment to appreciate the serene winter landscape while planning for a romantic outing ahead.",
