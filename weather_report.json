    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently experiencing crisp and cool conditions, with a temperature in the upper 40s complemented by a gentle, southerly breeze. The sky is predominantly cloudy, setting a grayish tone over the landscape, which may leave some feeling a touch dreary. There's a slight chance of rain showers moving in after midnight, but for now, conditions remain dry, allowing for a relatively pleasant evening outdoors, albeit a chilly one. \n\nAs we look ahead to Sunday, the forecast suggests a similar scenario with a slight chance of morning showers before 10 AM. Daytime temperatures are expected to rise to the high 50s and potentially dip again in the afternoon with a southwest breeze that may bring some gusts. The waves on Lake Michigan could be a bit choppy, depending on the wind conditions, making it less than ideal for boating but perhaps suitable for a brisk beach walk, bundled up, of course. As we're midway through November, these temperatures are fairly typical for the season, encouraging warm layers and perhaps a light rain jacket as a precaution. Given the weather, a peaceful stroll along the beach, a warm drink in hand, would be a fitting way to enjoy the day.",
