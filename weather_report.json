    "weather_report": "This morning in Evanston, conditions are chilly, with temperatures hovering in the low 20s and a noticeable breeze making it feel even cooler. The sky is mostly cloudy, casting a grayish hue over the landscape, and while the winds howl from the northwest, temperatures are expected to rise a bit throughout the day as we anticipate a high approaching the upper 20s. Tonight will bring more cloud cover, with the thermometer settling around the mid-20s, accompanied by a gentle south-southeast wind.\n\nWave conditions on Lake Michigan may be lively, given the current wind speeds, but precipitation appears to be absent from the forecast, lending a dry feel to the day's activities. Those venturing outdoors should dress warmly, donning layers, a sturdy coat, and a hat to keep the chill at bay. As winter grips the region, this weather aligns closely with what one might expect during early February in the Midwest. Given the current conditions, a brisk stroll along the beach or cozy indoor activities would suit the day well, as it provides an opportunity to enjoy the local scenery while staying warm.",
