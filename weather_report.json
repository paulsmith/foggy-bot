    "weather_report": "In Evanston today, the atmosphere feels decidedly crisp and cool, typical for mid-November. Current conditions show a cloudy sky, with temperatures in the low 50s and a gusty wind adding a brisk edge. This afternoon, expect mostly cloudy skies with temperatures hovering around 53 degrees, likely dipping slightly as the sun begins to set. There\u2019s a hint of rain in the forecast after midnight, but chances remain slim at just 20%. Given the cool breeze and overcast conditions, the day lacks the usual vibrancy of sunlight, painting the beach with a muted palette.\n\nWave conditions along Lake Michigan are mild, perfect for a peaceful stroll along the shoreline, although the brisk winds could make it feel a touch colder near the water. As a precaution, layering up is advised, with a warm jacket and perhaps a scarf to ward off the chill. While today may not feel festively seasonal, it captures the serene beauty of late fall. As we move closer to Thanksgiving week, it\u2019s a good reminder of the cozy indoor gatherings soon to come. Enjoy the quiet moments by the lake while they last; they are as much a part of the season as the festive cheer ahead.",
