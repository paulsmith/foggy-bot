    "weather_report": "As we look at Evanston, Illinois, the current scene is marked by a chilly and brisk atmosphere, with temperatures hovering in the mid 30s, while still maintaining a predominantly cloudy sky. The wind is rather fierce, sweeping in from the northwest, giving a biting edge to the night air that feels damp and cool. This will change as the overnight hours approach, bringing a high risk of patchy drizzle after 4 AM, with temperatures expected to settle around the low 40s.\n\nThe forecast for Friday reveals an overcast day with a high near 47 degrees, but a gradual drop in temperatures as the afternoon progresses. Winds will continue to be quite strong, maintaining their onslaught at 15 to 20 miles per hour with gusts reaching upwards to 30 miles per hour. While visibility may be limited with the clouds and possible drizzle, the wave conditions on Lake Michigan are likely to be moderate, with swells expected to also be influenced by the wind. For those venturing outside, layering is advisable; a warm, water-resistant coat along with a sturdy sweater underneath would be ideal to combat the chill and wind. \n\nConsidering the season, these temperatures fall below typical late November averages, which often see warmer days. With the festive spirit of Thanksgiving approaching, it may not be the most inviting weather to enjoy outdoor activities like strolling along the beach or picnicking. Rather, indoor gatherings, holiday preparations, or cozying up at home would be more suitable in this drizzly setting.",
