    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois present a chilly and blustery scene, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s and light snow creating a picturesque winter ambiance. The visibility is somewhat reduced, lending a soft veil to the landscape as flakes drift slowly down, while a fierce wind adds an invigorating bite to the air. This evening, expect snow to continue until about 1 AM, then transition into a mix of rain and snow as the temperature gradually rises to the mid 30s. With a substantial chance of precipitation, conditions will remain fairly damp and breezy, particularly with gusts approaching 25 miles per hour.\n\nTomorrow promises a similar wintry experience, with snow likely until around mid-morning followed by intermittent snow showers, and temperatures dipping back into the low 30s during the afternoon. The waves on Lake Michigan may be somewhat choppy but manageable, given the ongoing weather. Those venturing outdoors should consider bundling up in warm layers, donning a heavy coat, insulated gloves, and waterproof boots for comfort against the cold and wet conditions. Given that we are well into December, these temperatures align closely with typical seasonal expectations for the region, providing an authentic feel of a Midwest winter. As the holiday season approaches, it's a perfect time to enjoy cozy indoor activities or take brisk winter walks, embracing the serene beauty of Evanston\u2019s snow-dusted shorelines.",
