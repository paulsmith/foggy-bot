    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the evening air is cool and a bit blustery, with current temperatures settling in the low 40s. The atmosphere feels damp, adding a chill as clouds hang heavily overhead, shrouding the beach in a muted gray palette. Winds are howling from the northwest, lending a fierce intensity that stirs the lake\u2019s surface, creating notable wave activity. \n\nAs the night unfolds, expect cloudy skies with temperatures dipping toward the upper 30s and continuing blustery conditions\u2014gusts could reach up to 25 miles per hour. For Saturday, anticipate mostly cloudy skies, with a high peaking near the mid 40s before slipping back into the lower 40s by the afternoon, driven by a steady westward breeze. This time of year, temperatures are rather typical for late November in the Midwest, which tends to bring more chill than comfort. Those venturing outdoors should dress warmly, opting for layers, including a heavy coat, hat, and gloves to fend off the brisk air. Given the conditions, a leisurely walk on the beach could be invigorating but be prepared for uninviting gusts, while indoor activities may be more appealing with the approach of the Thanksgiving holiday.",
