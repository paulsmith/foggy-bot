    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois, present a stark winter landscape, with the temperature hovering in the low 30s, accompanied by a biting breeze that adds to a wintry chill. Light snow is falling, mingling with fog, creating a damp atmosphere that can feel quite raw. As snow accumulates and visibility dips, the day appears overcast and dreary, well-suited for staying indoors with a warm drink.\n\nThe forecast indicates continuing snow throughout the day, with temperatures peaking near mid 30s before slipping back into the low 30s by afternoon. Winds will be blustery, whipping in from the north at 20 to 25 miles per hour, with gusts reaching near 40 miles per hour. New snow accumulation may reach around an inch, making for slushy conditions by evening. As night descends, skies will partly clear, dropping to a low around 18, turning the air crisp and biting. The wave conditions off Lake Michigan are likely to be tumultuous, matching the gusty winds and the snow-covered shoreline.\n\nGiven the conditions, dressing in layers is essential\u2014opt for warm coats, hats, and gloves to combat the chill. Footwear suited for wet and icy surfaces is also advisable. Though the cold and snowy setting might deter many from venturing out, it offers an opportunity for winter activities like sledding or a brisk walk along the beach, as long as one is adequately dressed. Today marks a typical winter day in Evanston, reflecting the region's seasonal character, with winter's chill firmly in place.",
