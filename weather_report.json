    "weather_report": "Current weather in Evanston, Illinois, bears a crisp chill as temperatures hover in the upper 30s, combined with a brisk wind that feels quite fierce. The sky is mostly cloudy, lending a somewhat dim outlook to the day. As you venture outside, the air carries a noticeable bite, making it feel even cooler, and the conditions are anything but inviting without proper attire. Looking ahead, today's forecast suggests a transition toward partly sunny skies, with the temperature nudging up into the mid-50s by afternoon, before a series of scattered rain showers are expected tonight. Winds will shift to a gentler breeze, which is a welcome change from the morning's relentless gusts.\n\nDespite the potential for a few drops later on, the afternoon might offer a brief window for outdoor activities, particularly for brisk walks along the beach or park visits, as the temperatures warm slightly. However, keep a light jacket handy, especially as you head into the evening when temperatures dip back toward the mid-30s. Given that it is still winter, today's relatively cool weather is quite typical for this region, and while it's somewhat dreary, the promise of brighter skies later could provide a welcome reprieve.",
