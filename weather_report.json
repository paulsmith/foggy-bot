    "weather_report": "As evening sets in over Evanston, the current conditions reveal a crisp yet soothing charm, with temperatures in the low 60s and a light breeze stirring through the air. The sky is mostly clear, providing a broad view of the fading daylight and transitioning hues. Tonight, the forecast hints at a shift, with clouds rolling in and a possibility of rain after 3 AM, dropping temperatures to the low 40s. The winds will shift to a gentle westerly flow, occasionally gusting, ensuring a brisk feel as the night progresses.\n\nWave conditions along Lake Michigan are likely to remain calm to moderate, reflecting the gentle swells typical of this time of year. Although the current dialogue of the weather suggests a pleasant outdoor experience, hasty departures may be thwarted by the expected precipitation. Therefore, layered clothing is advisable\u2014perhaps a light jacket to fend off the cool air, complemented by a scarf or hat as temperatures dip. Given the setting, tonight presents an ideal opportunity for a stroll or perhaps settling into a cozy caf\u00e9 to enjoy the onset of the season\u2019s chill\u2014though keep an eye on the clouds, as they promise to bring some evening moisture.",
