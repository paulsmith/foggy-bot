    "weather_report": "The current conditions in Evanston paint a scene of thick fog enveloping the coastal landscape, where the air feels cool and damp. With temperatures resting in the low 50s, the atmosphere is reminiscent of early autumn mornings, characterized by a clingy chill that makes you reach for a light jacket. As day breaks, visibility may remain limited due to the fog, setting the stage for a gray and muted horizon. \n\nLooking ahead to the day, areas of fog are anticipated to linger until morning, giving way to rain showers that are likely to sweep through as temperatures rise slightly into the upper 50s. The day will see a gentle shift in winds, blowing from the east at 5 to 15 mph, bringing with it a heightened risk of precipitation\u201490% chance\u2014alongside expected rainfall of up to half an inch. While the wave conditions will be moderate due to the incoming weather, the dampness of the air and the probability of rain make it advisable to carry an umbrella. For those venturing outside, wearing a waterproof jacket and comfortable shoes will be essential. Given that it's mid-November, the cool temperatures are typical for the season, though the damp feel may render outdoor activities less enjoyable. Instead, curling up with a book indoors or visiting a cozy caf\u00e9 might be the perfect remedy for this chilly, fog-draped day.",
