    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston depict a dreary scene, with temperatures slumbering in the low 50s and an enveloping moisture that gives a fresh, misty feeling. The light drizzle and patchy fog lend a somber touch to the landscape, while a gentle southeast breeze rustles the leaves. Visibility may be limited, so outdoor enthusiasts should be mindful as they venture out. \n\nLooking ahead, the overnight hours promise a continuation of rain showers and areas of drizzle, with temperatures creeping to the mid 50s. Tomorrow may bring more of the same\u2014cloudy skies, with a likelihood of widespread drizzle and rain showers continuing into the morning. Expect the high to hover around 50, and for wind gusts to pick up, adding a bit of bite to the day. The overall atmosphere is decidedly damp, with a precipitation chance of 90% overnight and about 70% on Thursday. Given these conditions, those planning to step outdoors should prepare for a potentially blustery experience by dressing in layers and bringing an umbrella. It\u2019s certainly a day better spent indoors with a warm drink, reflective of the seasonal shift toward late autumn. With a major holiday approaching, the spirit of the season might inspire cozy indoor gatherings, despite the weather's reluctance to cooperate.",
