    "weather_report": "This evening in Evanston, the coastal air is cool and somewhat damp, with current temperatures settled in the low 50s. A blustery wind is stirring from the southeast, adding a bite to the evening. The sky remains mostly cloudy, with just patches of visibility to the east where Lake Michigan lies, creating a serene, albeit muted, shoreline view. As night falls, drizzle is likely to develop between 8 PM and 10 PM, with scattered showers thereafter, so residents might want to keep an umbrella handy.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, expect a continuation of the dreary weather as the temperatures hover around the low 50s during the day. Mornings may start with light drizzle, giving way to scattered rain showers later, and winds will be gusty, peaking at 20 to 30 mph. This kind of weather is typical for late November in the Midwest, signaling the onset of winter chill, where layering is key. As for activities, the weather may not be conducive to more vigorous outdoor plans; however, cozying up with a warm drink at a local caf\u00e9 or catching a movie might be ideal. With Thanksgiving just behind us, this rainy stretch sets a contemplative tone as the holiday season comes into full swing.",
