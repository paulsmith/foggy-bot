    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current conditions present a damp and gloomy atmosphere, with temperatures lingering in the mid 60s and a heavy blanket of humidity that feels oppressive in the cool night air. The strong winds are howling from the south, creating a blustery scene as light rain and mist veil the beach and Lake Michigan to the east. Tonight, residents can expect showers and thunderstorms, where some storms may bring heavy downpours, accumulating up to an inch of rain. With a low forecasted around the low 60s, the environment will remain cool and overcast, maintaining a feeling of wet chill.\n\nLooking ahead to Tuesday, the day promises more of the same, with steady showers and storms likely to persist throughout the day. Expect a high in the mid to upper 60s, but temperatures will gradually fall as the afternoon approaches, accompanied by gusty winds reaching up to 45 miles per hour. This combination of weather creates an overall unpleasant appearance along the shoreline, with choppy wave conditions stirred up by the wind. Those venturing out should dress warmly in waterproof layers, perhaps donning a raincoat and sturdy footwear to navigate through puddles and soggy ground. Given that the season is autumn, these cooling temperatures are typical for the region, although the intensity of the rainfall is a reminder that winter is approaching. With the inclement weather, outdoor activities are best postponed; instead, consider cozy indoor pursuits, perhaps curling up with a good book or enjoying a warm cup of something comforting while weathering the storms inside.",
