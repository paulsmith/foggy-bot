A strong, blustery westerly wind wraps around the coast at 20 mph, contributing to the chilly feel, accentuated by the slightly damp air. As we look ahead, the daytime is forecasted to bring a shift to sunny skies and a high reaching into the upper 20s, though the temperature may dip into the mid-20s during the afternoon. This forthcoming wave of sunshine promises a brighter outlook, but be prepared for a cold day ahead as you venture outside.\n\nGiven the current weather, it\u2019s advisable to bundle up tightly; layers are key in these conditions. A thick coat, gloves, and a warm hat will help counter the biting chill of the wind. As for activities, today\u2019s weather is well-suited for a brisk stroll along the beach\u2014just be mindful of the wind chill\u2014and perhaps a warm beverage afterward to stay toasty. This December day, where we're firmly in the clutches of winter, showcases temperatures typical for the region, although the clear skies offer a beautiful contrast to the otherwise cold surroundings.",
