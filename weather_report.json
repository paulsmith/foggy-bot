    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Evanston unfolds with partly sunny skies, a pleasant warmth reaching towards 79 degrees. The brisk south-southwest wind, gusting up to 40 mph, adds a lively edge to the day, stirring both the air and the waters of Lake Michigan. As the sun begins its descent, the conditions suggest a shift; an incoming chance of showers and thunderstorms looms on the horizon, with expected precipitation hitting between the early hours of the morning.\n\nBy tonight, expect a more somber atmosphere; clouds will blanket the skies, with temperatures quietly rising to a mild 66 degrees. The winds will remain steady, keeping a refreshing chill in the air as humidity increases with the approaching storms. While the beach may appear inviting, with calm waves reflecting the muted light, one should prepare to adapt as the weather transitions. It may be wise to dress in layers, opting for a light jacket to ward off evening coolness and potential rain. As the evening approaches, local residents might find enjoyment in a cozy indoor activity\u2014a visit to a nearby caf\u00e9 or a leisurely stroll through the waterfront park, enjoying the last whispers of autumn before rain settles in.",
