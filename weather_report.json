    "weather_report": "In Evanston this afternoon, the scene is marked by a blend of sun and clouds, with a gentle warmth settling in around 79 degrees. The brisk south-southwest wind, gusting up to 35 miles per hour, adds a lively edge to the air, creating a refreshing backdrop along the shoreline. As the day transitions into evening, the atmosphere thickens with an impending storm; a wave of showers and thunderstorms is expected to sweep in shortly after midnight. With a low around 64 degrees, rising just slightly overnight, the humidity will lend a sweltering feel as temperatures begin to climb again under the cover of clouds.\n\nAt the beach, the rolling waves of Lake Michigan suggest a mild restlessness, not entirely calm but inviting for those wishing to appreciate the natural beauty, albeit with caution. The early evening may tempt visitors to bundle up against the chill brought in with the winds, perhaps opting for a light jacket. While the current harbor resembles a serene retreat, the forecast suggests a notable shift to wet conditions soon\u2014activities should lean toward the more subdued, perhaps an evening stroll along the shore before the clouds gather in earnest. Given the end of daylight saving time, the dusk will descend earlier, wrapping the beach scenes in a quiet reflection, ideally suited for internal contemplation or quiet conversation as the winds flutter through the trees.",
