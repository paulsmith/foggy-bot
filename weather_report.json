    "weather_report": "Evanston, Illinois is currently experiencing a chilly day, with temperatures hovering around the low 30s and a brisk wind giving it a biting feel. The atmosphere is dominated by thick clouds, and the air is palpable with an impending sense of precipitation. This morning, the wind gusts are strong, contributing to an overall sense of winter's grip. As the day progresses, expect a series of wintry conditions: likely freezing rain from midday transitioning into a mix of rain and snow later in the afternoon. Though the high may barely inch upward to 33, little ice accumulation is anticipated, aligning with the day's fluid, drizzly demeanor.\n\nTonight, conditions will remain mostly cloudy, and with nighttime temperatures slipping to the low 20s, residents should prepare for a potentially icy scene. The wind will continue its blustery presence, making it feel even colder. Given the current wintry weather and the overcast skies, it's advisable to bundle up in warm layers, perhaps opting for insulated jackets, hats, and gloves if stepping outside. While outdoor activities may be limited to brief strolls or necessary errands, it's a good day for cozy indoor pursuits, reflecting on the winter season's persistence as it settles over this lakeside region.",
