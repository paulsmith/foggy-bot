    "weather_report": "In Evanston, current conditions present a chilly scene characterized by a temperature in the low 40s, which, coupled with a brisk and blustery wind, creates a rather biting atmosphere. The air is thick with cloud cover, resulting in a muted palette across the landscape, particularly as visibility over Lake Michigan may be limited by the ongoing overcast skies. As we look ahead, the forecast calls for an overnight dip to a low around 39, with gentle northwest breezes calming slightly tomorrow. Saturday promises mostly cloudy skies with temperatures peaking near the mid 40s, creating a continued sense of coolness throughout the day.\n\nThe overall appearance is quite gloomy, with the lake\u2019s waves reflecting the choppy conditions instigated by winds gusting at times to 20 mph. While precipitation isn\u2019t expected today, the air carries a damp chill, making any outings rather uncomfortable unless dressed appropriately. Layering with a warm coat, perhaps a hat and gloves, is advisable to ward off the bite of the cold. Temperatures this time of year are typical for late November in the Midwest, keeping in line with seasonal expectations. Outdoor activities may be limited, but a stroll along the beach or visit to local cafes could provide some mild enjoyment, as long as one is prepared for the brisk air and cloudy ambiance.",
