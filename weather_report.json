    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a rather damp and foggy evening, with temperatures hovering in the mid to high 50s, complemented by an oppressive mugginess that weighs heavily in the air. The howling winds, reaching upwards of 50 mph, suggest a fierce atmosphere, making it feel quite raw for those outdoors. As we look ahead, the forecast indicates a continuation of this grim weather. Rain is expected to commence shortly, potentially bringing thunderstorms, with the mercury dipping slightly overnight but rising again to near 58 by dawn. Tomorrow, the threat of sporadic rain showers will linger, but it seems that we may see some breaks in the clouds as the day progresses.\n\nGiven these conditions, the scenery along the lakefront likely appears gloomy and uninviting, with choppy waves adding to the tumult of the surroundings. While the relentless rain may deter outdoor activities, those undeterred by the weather may find solace in warm, cozy venues, perhaps enjoying a good book or a warm beverage. Attire fitting for the evening calls for waterproof layers and sturdy shoes, as the conditions are unlikely to improve significantly through the night or tomorrow. As we find ourselves in mid-November, these temperatures align closely with what one would expect for this time of year in the Midwest\u2014crisp yet slightly unwelcoming\u2014as holiday festivities draw nearer in the coming weeks.",
