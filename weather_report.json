    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently experiencing chilly conditions as the temperature hovers just below freezing, accompanied by a light breeze coming from the west-northwest. The atmosphere feels crisp and cool, ideal for a brisk walk or invigorating outing, especially along the scenic shoreline of Lake Michigan. Fortunately, the skies are mostly clear, providing a bright contrast to the wintry landscape, with no precipitation expected, allowing residents to enjoy the natural beauty without interruption. \n\nAs we move through the afternoon, temperatures will rise slightly but will still remain in the lower 30s, complemented by a gentle breeze. Tonight, expect partly cloudy skies with temperatures dipping into the upper teens, maintaining the season's winter chill. Given the current seasonal realities, these temperatures are quite typical for early December in this region, and dressing in layers with warm outerwear will be essential to stay comfortable. The conditions are great for a walk along the beach or a cozy evening gathering, perhaps with hot beverages in hand as we embrace the beauty of the season.",
