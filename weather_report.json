    "weather_report": "As we look to Evanston this evening, the air is lightly graced by rain, creating a rather damp atmosphere, with a temperature nestled in the low 50s. The feel is decidedly cool and somewhat sticky, with a blustery wind sweeping in from the west-southwest. Visibility is reduced due to this light precipitation and the onset of patchy fog expected later tonight. Tomorrow's forecast suggests the persistence of fog in the morning, leading into a day characterized by mostly cloudy skies and intervals of rain showers, with temperatures inching up to the mid 50s.\n\nIn terms of outdoor conditions, the beach looks dark and quiet, and wave conditions may be choppy thanks to the gusty winds, making it less than ideal for any water activities. Given the cool temperatures and potential for ongoing rain, dressing in layers with waterproof outerwear is advisable, along with sturdy footwear to navigate damp surfaces. It's mid-November, and temperatures around this time are aligning with typical seasonal patterns. While the weather may deter outdoor adventures, it could be a cozy evening to enjoy indoor activities such as visiting local caf\u00e9s or catching up with a good book by the window as the rain patters softly outside.",
