    "weather_report": "As dawn approaches in Evanston, the night air carries the promise of rain, with scattered thunderstorms a likelihood in the hours ahead. Currently, the temperature rests comfortably around 64 degrees, but it is expected to creep upward as the night unfolds. A robust south-southwest wind is stirring with notable gusts, adding a vigorous touch to the atmosphere, hinting at a transition that will see weather conditions shift substantially by midday. The forecast suggests a high near 66 degrees, yet it may feel much cooler as the afternoon progresses. \n\nResidents should anticipate a day characterized by a damp chill, with the rising likelihood of rain leading to puddled streets. Given the high potential for precipitation\u2014about a quarter to half an inch\u2014venturing outdoors will require cautious attire. A light waterproof jacket and sturdy shoes would provide comfort while weathering the elements. The beach, though shrouded in night, reflects a mood that may soon shift from tranquil to tumultuous as the waves pick up strength with the brewing winds. Engaging in leisurely indoor activities such as visiting a local bookstore or enjoying a warm beverage at a caf\u00e9 might be the most appealing choices today, allowing one to stay dry while observing the dramatic interplay of autumn weather outside.",
