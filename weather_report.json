    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the current weather presents a wintry scene, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s, accompanied by light snow and gusty winds. The chilly air bites slightly, making it feel particularly brisk as wind gusts sweep in from the west. The shoreline, likely shrouded in a muted haze, reflects the somber atmosphere of a late autumn night. Despite the snowfall, visibility is moderately clear, though the looming clouds hint at a more tumultuous day ahead.\n\nLooking forward, scattered snow showers will persist into the overnight hours, accompanied by a low that chills just below freezing. The forecast predicts a more significant weather shift tomorrow, with steady snow transitioning to rain by the afternoon as temperatures rise into the mid-40s. Waves along the lake may be amplified by these winds, reaching a fierce intensity that could deter casual beachgoers. In light of these conditions, layers are advisable\u2014warm coats, scarves, and sturdy footwear will help shield against the elements. As the holiday season approaches, the uninviting cold might encourage quieter indoor activities like cozy gatherings or reflective walks rather than outdoor excursions to the beach, unless one craves the raw beauty of a snowy lakeside vista.",
