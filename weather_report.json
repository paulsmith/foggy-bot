    "weather_report": "A cool and blustery morning blanket Evanston, Illinois, with current temperatures hovering in the mid-20s. The air feels crisp enough to bite at exposed skin, a reminder that winter is firmly entrenched as the winds whip in from the southwest. Light snow is expected later, mixing with rain this afternoon as clouds dominate the sky, casting a gray hue over the shoreline. As the day unfolds, temperatures will rise slightly, climbing to the low 30s, accompanied by a gentle yet gusty breeze.\n\nToday's weather will likely be unpleasant for outdoor enthusiasts, with the combination of snow and drizzle making for a damp experience. Waves along the Lake Michigan shore are expected to be moderate, reflecting the restless energy brought by the winds. Given the forecast, it would be wise to dress warmly; layers, a waterproof jacket, and gloves will provide comfort against the chill and moisture. This December day is characterized by typical Midwest winter conditions, bracing and biting, yet undeniably part of the seasonal landscape. While outdoor activities may be limited due to the impending weather, cozying up with a good book or enjoying the festive preparations indoors could be a delightful alternative as we approach the holiday season.",
