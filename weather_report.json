    "weather_report": "As the evening settles upon Evanston, current conditions reveal a chilly atmosphere with temperatures dipping into the upper 20s. The humidity adds a crispness to the air, making it feel even cooler as a steady, blustery wind pulls at anything not anchored down. The sky, cloaked in clouds, casts a muted glow over the landscape, creating a scene that feels both serene and somber, perfect for a contemplative stroll along the beach if one is adequately bundled. \n\nLooking ahead, tonight brings mostly cloudy skies with temperatures dropping further to around the mid 20s, accompanied by a gentle west northwest wind. Tomorrow, residents can expect a chance of snow in the afternoon, with mainly cloudy conditions and highs reaching into the mid 30s. While precipitation is a possibility, it\u2019s likely to be light with new accumulations under half an inch. Hence, those venturing outdoors should dress warmly in layers, perhaps donning a heavy coat and sturdy boots to navigate the potentially icy paths. The season brings typical chill for December in the Midwest, suggesting it\u2019s a good time for winter activities\u2014perhaps a brisk walk or a visit to a local caf\u00e9 to escape the cold. As we approach the holiday season, the atmosphere is certainly festive, holding the promise of snow as we count down the days until celebrations commence.",
