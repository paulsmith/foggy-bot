    "weather_report": "In Evanston this morning, the temperature hovers in the low 30s, with a biting chill mingling with the dampness in the air, creating a raw, wintry feel. Winds are howling from the northwest, reinforcing the cold with brisk gusts that are sure to cut through any light layers. The skies are mostly cloudy, providing just a muted glimpse of the morning light, while conditions are expected to remain dreary throughout the day, with a high reaching only the mid 30s. Tonight, the temperature will dip further into the upper 20s, accompanied by calmer winds. \n\nAs for wave conditions on Lake Michigan, the choppy waters are likely stirred by the persistent wind, making for a tumultuous sight along the shoreline. There are no significant signs of precipitation today, allowing for an unremarkably dry winter's day. Dress warmly if venturing outside; layered, insulated clothing and a good pair of gloves will be crucial to combat the elements. Despite this winter chill typical for December in the Midwest, it may not offer the most inviting atmosphere for outdoor activities. The beach may be best appreciated from indoors, potentially enjoying a warm beverage while watching the waves crash from the comfort of a cozy nook. With the festive season approaching, keep an eye out for holiday gatherings that could bring warmth amidst this wintry backdrop.",
