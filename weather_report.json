    "weather_report": "Evanston's afternoon unfolds with a mix of sunshine and a brisk breeze, all part of a pleasantly warm palette that dances around 79 degrees. The south-southwest winds whip along the shoreline, creating a refreshing atmosphere as they gust up to 40 mph, teasing the lake's surface. As the day wanes, clouds will gather, hinting at the impending shift in weather, with chances rising for showers and thunderstorms overnight, carrying an 80% chance of precipitation. While the sand remains dry for now, the cobblestones by the pier might soon feel the touch of rain, as the forecast suggests a sizable accumulation overnight.\n\nGiven the season, these temperatures reflect a comfortable late October, though the approaching storm may warrant a light jacket or a waterproof layer later in the evening. The waves appear relatively calm at this hour, gently lapping at the shore, inviting thoughtful strolls rather than energetic activities. As twilight approaches, a leisurely jaunt along the beach, or perhaps settling into a cozy caf\u00e9 with a view of the darkening horizon, may be the perfect way to savor the evening before the storms roll in.",
