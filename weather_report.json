    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly atmosphere, with temperatures settling in the low 20s, compounded by a notable cloudiness that shrouds the skyline. As the evening progresses, residents can anticipate a chance of snow showers, transitioning to more persistent snowfall as temperatures gradually nudge up toward mid-20s overnight. The predicted winds, arriving from the northeast, will come in with a gentle, whistling breeze, adding a touch of biting chill to the air. \n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, snow is expected to blanket the area, with a potential accumulation of 2 to 4 inches. With a high hovering near the upper 20s, outdoor conditions are likely to appear dreary and damp, making for a potentially unpleasant outing by the lake. While the snow may invite some to engage in winter activities, emerging conditions demand caution, especially considering the possibility of slippery surfaces. Given the time of year, these temperatures align with typical winter weather for the region, though the frigid feel may encourage bundling up in warm layers, including heavy coats, hats, and gloves. As always, a thoughtful approach to outdoor activities\u2014perhaps staying cozy indoors with a warm drink\u2014might be the most appealing option for the evening.",
