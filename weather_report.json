    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston paint a chilly and cloudy picture, with temperatures hovering in the mid 20s. The air feels crisp and cool, suitable for bundling up as you step outside. As the night continues, expect the weather to turn more unsettled with temperatures dipping slightly to the high 20s and a brisk easterly wind bringing a noticeable chill. The forecast for Saturday anticipates a cloudy day with a significant chance of mixed precipitation developing in the afternoon, possibly sleet or a light wintry mix. \n\nThe waves along Lake Michigan may be slightly animated, but quite manageable given the current calmness of the winds. As for attire, don warm layers, including a sturdy coat and accessories like hats and gloves, to fend off the biting cold and wind while venturing out. As we embrace the winter season, these temperatures are typical for December in this region, creating an unmistakable holiday-time atmosphere. Given the inclement weather, it may be best to curtail outdoor activities in favor of cozy indoor experiences, perhaps warming up with a drink or enjoying a good book, as the festive season approaches.",
