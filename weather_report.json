    "weather_report": "In Evanston this afternoon, the weather presents a blend of partly sunny skies and a brisk, cooling breeze. As daylight wanes, temperatures are expected to hover around 66 degrees, but will gently trend down towards 52, making the air feel noticeably crisper. The wind, swirling from the west-southwest at around 30 mph with gusts soaring to 45 mph, is likely to generate a lively atmosphere along the beach, where the waves dance against the shoreline with a bit more vigor than usual. \n\nAs the sun sets, the clouds will take on a more subdued character, leaving a partly cloudy evening in their wake, with lows nearing 40. It\u2019s a remarkably seasonal afternoon for late October, and with Halloween beckoning, the atmosphere has a festive allure despite the bluster. Those venturing out should consider layering some warm clothing and perhaps donning a windbreaker to shield against the gusts. Sweaters or light jackets paired with jeans would suit the weather well, allowing for comfort as one enjoys a stroll along the lakeshore or participates in local festivities. With the waves appearing slightly choppy, this might not be the best day for boating, but a beach walk or a trip to a nearby caf\u00e9 could provide a refreshing and invigorating experience on this October day.",
