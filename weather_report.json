    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston paint a picture of a chilly, blustery evening with temperatures hovering in the low 30s. The air carries a dampness that adds to the coolness, making it feel even more brisk. The sky is overcast, casting a gloomy hue over the shoreline, where tufts of wind whip across the beach as gusts approach a fierce intensity. Tonight, residents can expect a chance of snow showers as the temperature dips to around 27, accompanied by a more manageable northwest wind.\n\nAs we look to Wednesday, snow is likely after the morning hours, with the high reaching only into the low 30s before temperatures slide into the lower 20s later in the day. The winds will remain busy, potentially impacting visibility along the lakefront as clouds hang thick. While the precipitation may not accumulate to significant levels, the evening air will carry a sharp chill typical for this time of the year in the Midwest. For those venturing outside, layered clothing, a warm hat, and gloves are recommended to ward off the wintery bite. The conditions may not be inviting for extended outdoor pursuits, but a brisk walk or a short visit to admire the winter scenery could offer a refreshing experience in this weather.",
