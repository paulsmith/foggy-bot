    "weather_report": "Currently in Evanston, the air is chilly and damp, with a temperature in the mid-30s and a gentle mist adding to the cool atmosphere. A light rain is falling while a breeze carries a hint of fog over the beach, creating a somewhat melancholic yet peaceful scene. This evening, expect more rain and patchy fog until the early hours, accompanied by a steady increase in temperature as we move into the low 40s overnight. The wind will pick up a bit, gusting from the southeast, further enhancing the damp, crisp conditions.\n\nTomorrow, a cloudy sky will persist with occasional drizzle through the afternoon, maintaining that overcast feel. With a high near the low 40s, though still chilly, it\u2019s a good idea to dress warmly with layers and waterproof attire. The beach, while scenic, may not beckon for leisurely walks due to the rain and breeze. However, tomorrow\u2019s conditions could be suitable for indoor activities such as cozying up at a local caf\u00e9 with a warm beverage or visiting a nearby museum to escape the chill. As it is mid-December, these conditions are typical for this time of year in Illinois, a reminder of winter\u2019s firm grip on the region.",
