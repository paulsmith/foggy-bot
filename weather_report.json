A fierce breeze sweeps across the beach, whipping the waves into a bubbling froth as they rhythmically crash against the shore, driving a chill through the air that calls for warm layers and waterproof attire. Tonight, rain showers are guaranteed, with temperatures only shifting slightly to a low around the upper 50s. The southeast winds promise gusts that could whip around 40 mph, making for a blustery evening.\n\nAs we look toward the forecasted weather for Tuesday, there's a chance of rain likely to linger until the morning, giving way to mostly cloudy skies and a high near 60\u2014an indication of the changing seasons in this lakeside city. The temperature, typically cool for this time of year, encourages indoor activities, where one can escape the elements with a warm drink or a cozy evening indoors. While the views of Lake Michigan may be obscured by fog, engaging in a thoughtful read or enjoying the quiet hum of the rain might just be the remedy for a chilly November night.",
