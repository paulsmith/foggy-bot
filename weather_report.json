    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Evanston, the air hangs heavy with humidity, and the temperature lingers in the mid-60s, presenting a rather damp and gray picture. Light rain falls steadily, blurring the edges of the landscape while a brisk, gusty wind from the south whips through the area, creating a chill that might catch you off guard. The current conditions herald an overnight forecast of persistent rain, as temperatures dip to the low 60s and winds remain, howling occasionally with gusts nearing 30 mph\u2014this is not an inviting scene for outdoor pursuits.\n\nLooking ahead to Monday, rain will continue to dominate the morning, tapering off slightly by noon, but the day promises lingering clouds and the potential for afternoon showers or even thunderstorms. With a high creeping into the upper 60s but likely falling later in the day, it delineates an unseasonably cool and soggy condition reminiscent of early fall rather than the late autumn we find ourselves in. The turbulent waters of Lake Michigan will likely continue to churn, reflecting the day's blustery ambiance.\n\nGiven the precipitation and overcast skies, it\u2019s advisable to don water-resistant attire\u2014think raincoats and sturdy footwear\u2014and perhaps carry an umbrella for added protection. This weather certainly calls for cozy indoor activities; reading a good book by the window, visiting local cafes, or perhaps catching a film. Interactions with the brisk outdoors would be best reserved for those ready to embrace the elements fully.",
