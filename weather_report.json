    "weather_report": "The current weather in Evanston, Illinois, paints a picture of a foggy and cool night with temperatures settling in the low 50s. The air feels damp and heavy, a testament to the moisture lingering in the atmosphere. As dawn approaches, patchy fog is likely to continue, giving way to a blend of clouds and scattered rain expected throughout the day. The high will only reach the mid 50s, accompanied by a gentle easterly breeze that may pick up later, bringing sporadic gusts.\n\nOverall, the shoreline might appear rather dreary for outdoor activities, especially with the looming possibility of rain showers. Those planning to venture out will find the beach setting less inviting under the gloomy skies and with the likelihood of dampness. Given the cloudy conditions and moderate chances of precipitation, a light waterproof jacket or layer will be necessary for comfort. The current temperature aligns with late autumn expectations, yet the abundant moisture could create a decidedly chilly feel. With this weather in mind, the ideal activity would likely center around cozy indoor pursuits rather than strolls along the beach, especially as the season transitions deeper into winter.",
