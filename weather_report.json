    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the current weather presents a rather chilly scene, with temperatures hovering in the mid-30s, accentuated by a blustery wind sweeping off Lake Michigan. The clouds overhead create a drab backdrop, while the air carries a damp chill, making it feel even cooler. As we look ahead to this afternoon, expect more cloud cover with a high near 43 degrees, though temperatures will likely settle back into the upper 30s by the end of the day. Tonight brings a shift to patchy fog and drizzle, with low temperatures around freezing, making it essential to prepare for a damp evening.\n\nWave conditions along the lake might be slight, but the ongoing wind creates a restless surface. Given these conditions, attire that includes layers\u2014perhaps a warm, waterproof jacket and sturdy shoes\u2014will offer the best comfort against the elements. In this late November season, these temperatures are fairly typical for the region, as the Midwest transitions into winter. As for activities, outdoor endeavors may be limited due to the fog and chill, but a brisk walk along the beach could still prove invigorating for those well-prepared for the weather, all while soaking in the tranquil atmosphere prior to the holiday rush.",
