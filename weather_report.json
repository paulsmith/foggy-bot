    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over the beach in Evanston, temperatures hover in the low 20s, fostering a brisk, biting chill penetrated by a persistent drizzle mixed with light snow and swirling mist. With the humidity enveloping the area, outdoor conditions feel quite damp and raw, compounded by a fierce north-northeast wind that sends flurries racing across the shoreline. Visibility may be compromised as fog drapes over Lake Michigan, dulling the crisp horizon and lending an icy ambiance to the morning.\n\nLooking ahead, today promises snow showers with periods of freezing drizzle, particularly in the afternoon, as temperatures struggle to reach the upper 20s before dipping again tonight. Snow accumulation will likely range between one to three inches, with a chance a few fleeting gusts might blow snow into drifts along the beach. The waves rolling in are considerably agitated, influenced by those gusty winds, making for a potentially tumultuous scene along the waterfront. Given the chill and dampness, dressing warmly in layers\u2014complete with hats, gloves, and waterproof outerwear\u2014remains essential for anyone venturing outdoors. As winter envelops the Great Lakes region, these temperatures are typical for early January, demanding both caution and care as residents and visitors navigate the conditions. While this day may not be ideal for outdoor activities, those keen on winter sports could find solace in the snow, or perhaps retreat indoors to embrace the warmth of a cozy caf\u00e9\u2014savoring a hot drink while watching the flurries dance beyond the window.",
