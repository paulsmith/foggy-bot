The strong winds are howling from the northeast, causing a brisk chill that penetrates layers, and while visibility may be reduced due to the snowfall, the ground is likely to accumulate a fresh dusting as the evening progresses. Tonight, expect snow to intensify, with temperatures plunging to the low teens and potentially rising overnight\u2014a stark contrast that could create a wintry wonderland.\n\nTomorrow, a shift to mostly sunny skies is anticipated, with a high near the low 20s. However, it will still feel quite cold, as characteristic wind chills could dip to the single digits. With such blustery conditions at the lakefront, the waves may be moderately choppy, offering a dramatic vista of frothy whitecaps against the muted sky. Given the chill factor and ongoing snow, warm and layered clothing is advised, including hats and gloves to fend off the cold. While February may be a time for winter sports, today\u2019s conditions shy away from outdoor relaxation, favoring snug indoor activities instead.",
