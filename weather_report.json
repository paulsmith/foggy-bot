    "weather_report": "Evanston's morning chill is palpable, with temperatures hovering in the low single digits and a brisk, howling wind from the northwest adding to the frosty air. While the clouds blanket the sky, creating a grayish backdrop, the atmosphere remains alive with a slight moisture content. As we move into the day, expect intermittent snow showers to begin after two o'clock, contributing to an overall chilly aesthetic that can feel uninviting. This afternoon, temperatures are projected to rise only slightly, reaching about 16 degrees, before falling again as evening approaches. Wind chill values could dip as low as -5, making this a day best suited for those who thrive in frigid conditions rather than for outdoor leisure.\n\nThe waves lapping the shores of Lake Michigan might be stirred up by the gusty winds, making for a rougher shoreline; if you venture outdoors, bundle up in layers with a warm hat and gloves to stave off the biting cold. Local activities may lean towards indoor options, like visiting nearby caf\u00e9s or museums, where you can escape the winter weather's grasp. Given that today is not marked by any major holiday or event, it\u2019s a typical, albeit frigid wintry day in this lakeside community. With temperatures and conditions like these, it's pretty clear that winter's grip remains firmly in place, and that\u2019s typical for this time of year in the Midwest.",
