    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather paints a chilly picture, with temperatures hovering in the mid 30s under a cloudy sky. The evening air carries a brisk, blustery feel, with winds whispering from the west at nearly 21 miles per hour, adding a bite to the air that feels particularly sharp as you approach Lake Michigan. As the night progresses, there's a slight chance of snow flurries before dawn, with temperatures dipping down to the low 30s; however, any accumulation is expected to be negligible.\n\nLooking ahead to Wednesday, residents can expect a mostly cloudy day, with temperatures climbing only to the mid 40s before shifting downward in the afternoon. Light winds will offer a more subdued experience, yet the overall ambiance remains cool and somewhat damp. While it may not be ideal beach weather, the chilly temps and gusty winds bring a defining feel of late autumn in the Midwest. Dress warmly in layers, with perhaps a good coat and a pair of insulated gloves for those brief jaunts outdoors. If you\u2019re brave, a stroll along the beachfront to enjoy the wintry view may provide a refreshing escape, especially as the holiday season approaches and the town begins to twinkle with seasonal lights.",
