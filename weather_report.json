    "weather_report": "This evening in Evanston, the weather is distinctly winter-like, with temperatures hovering in the low 20s. The air feels crisp and cool, accompanied by a gentle breeze that offers just a hint of chill as it sweeps in from the northwest. The clarity of the night sky promises a peaceful ambiance, perfect for a quiet evening stroll along the lakeshore. No precipitation is in sight, keeping the shoreline dry and inviting. \n\nAs we look ahead to tomorrow, expect mostly sunny skies with temperatures rising to the low 30s, although they'll begin to retreat subtly by the afternoon. The forecast indicates another refreshing day, ideal for enjoying the outdoors if bundled properly. Given the seasonal chill and that we're well into December, dress warmly in layers and perhaps consider a cozy hat, gloves, and a scarf for added comfort. With no holidays on the immediate horizon, it\u2019s a fine time for a peaceful winter walk or perhaps enjoying a hot beverage at a local caf\u00e9 while taking in the scenery of Lake Michigan.",
