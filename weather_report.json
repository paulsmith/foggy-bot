    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current conditions paint a rather chilly scene, with temperatures hovering in the upper 30s and a persistent cloud cover that adds to the brisk atmosphere. The wind is strong and blustery, creating a noticeable bite to the air as it sweeps in from the southwest. This afternoon, expect similar cloudiness with temperatures inching just a touch upward before dipping again, accompanied by gentle winds carrying a hint of warmth. As night falls, the clouds will remain, and a slight drop in temperatures to the mid-30s will set in, leading to a calm evening with only light breezes.\n\nOverall, today\u2019s weather gives off a rather gloomy vibe, with dim light reflecting off the gray waters of Lake Michigan. Wave conditions may be slightly choppy due to the blustery winds, making it less than ideal for water-based activities. With no precipitation in the forecast, the day remains dry, but the cooler temperatures dictate that layered attire is essential to stay warm and comfortable while outdoors. In this late November setting, the temperatures are about what one would expect for the season, prompting thoughts of indoor activities such as visiting local caf\u00e9s or art galleries, where one can find warmth and solace from the biting winds. As today is not a holiday, it's a typical day for engagement with community events or preparations for the upcoming festive season.",
