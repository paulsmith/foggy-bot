    "weather_report": "As dawn approaches in Evanston, the current temperature hovers in the low 20s, accompanied by a brisk, blustery wind from the west. The air feels quite chilly, with a mix of moisture that underscores the winter chill. Skies are mostly clear now, but a shift toward mostly cloudy conditions is expected overnight, bringing a low around 18 degrees. Tomorrow promises a slight warming trend as we anticipate partly sunny skies, with temperatures peaking in the low 30s before falling again in the afternoon.\n\nToday, the atmosphere may appear a bit dreary as cloud cover increases. The lake will likely present moderate wave conditions, perfect for observing the seasonal turmoil of Lake Michigan. There\u2019s no precipitation anticipated, allowing for a dry day, albeit quite chilly. For those venturing outside, layered clothing is advisable to fend off the cold and wind. A winter coat, gloves, and perhaps a warm hat will make for a more comfortable outing. Given the season, these temperatures are typical for early December in the Midwest, where winter has firmly established its grip. Suggested activities might include a brisk walk along the beach or enjoying the serene beauty of the lakefront, taking in the quietude that only a winter morning can provide.",
