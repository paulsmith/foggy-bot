    "weather_report": "Under the leaden skies of Evanston, the air feels crisp and cool, with temperatures currently straddling the mid-30s. A notable breeze from the southeast adds a brisk chill, making the afternoon feel quite blustery as the weather transitions. As we look ahead, rain is poised to arrive after 3 PM, heralding a wet evening with temperatures inching up towards the upper 30s. Tonight, a steady rain is expected to blanket the area before midnight, accompanied by patchy drizzle and fog, making for a rather dreary atmosphere.\n\nGiven the impending precipitation and the choppy waters of Lake Michigan, conditions at the beach are far from inviting. The waves are restless, matching the turbulent skies. The atmosphere could be described as unpleasant, particularly for outdoor activities. Attire should lean towards warmth and water-resistance\u2014think heavy jackets or raincoats, and don\u2019t forget to wear sturdy footwear, as the ground is likely to become slick. Temperatures this time of year are typical for mid-December, fitting within the expectations for this region. With certainly no festive atmosphere today, those hoping for outdoor recreational pursuits may instead find solace indoors, perhaps by cozying up with a book or enjoying a warm beverage. As this day unfolds, it\u2019s a time to prepare for a chilly, wet evening ahead.",
