    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently experiencing a cool, overcast day marked by light snow, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s. The air carries a crispness that, combined with the dampness in the atmosphere, adds a chill that permeates your bones. As we look forward to this afternoon, expect a continuation of the cloudy skies with a chance of snow showers; temperatures will dip toward the upper 20s as the north winds whip through at a brisk pace, lending a blustery feel to the day.\n\nAs for conditions by the lake, the waves are likely to be choppy due to the strong winds, making for a rather rough appearance at the shoreline. Should you find it necessary to venture outdoors, be advised that warm, layered attire is essential to combat the briskness of the day and the falling temperatures. While the overall scene may appear gloomy, the beauty of the lakefront in winter can be striking, and a brisk walk could invigorate those who are bundled up sufficiently. With the holiday season approaching, it might be a good time to enjoy the festive decorations in local neighborhoods, keeping in mind that this is not only a typical winter day for the region but also one rich with potential for cozy gatherings and reflections as we approach the year's end.",
