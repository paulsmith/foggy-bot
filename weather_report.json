    "weather_report": "This morning in Evanston, a refreshing chill greets residents as the temperature hovers in the low 40s, accompanied by a damp atmosphere under partly cloudy skies. The brisk, whispering winds from the southeast stir the lake, creating a gentle swell but no significant wave action to worry beachgoers. As we move into the day, forecasts promise a transition toward warmer, mostly sunny conditions with a high approaching the upper 50s. This afternoon, temperatures will slightly dip as clouds drift in, yet the gentle south-southeast breeze will keep the air feeling lively.\n\nAs night falls, expect a low in the upper 40s, with the warmth of the day giving way to a calm evening under the stars. With no precipitation forecasted and the visibility remaining clear, it's an excellent opportunity for a stroll along the shoreline or a cozy gathering at local parks. Dress in layers to adjust to the temperature fluctuations, and perhaps don a light jacket for later. As we embrace the fall season, the beauty of Lake Michigan beckons residents to enjoy the serenity of late autumn.",
