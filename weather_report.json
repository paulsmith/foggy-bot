    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current scene is painted with light snow creating a wintry chill, as temperatures hover in the low 25s, and a fierce northwest wind gusts to nearly 50 miles per hour, giving an unsettled feel to the day. Looking ahead, the forecast suggests intermittent snow showers will continue overnight, with cloudy skies and a low near 24. Tomorrow, expect a mix of snow showers tapering off by noon, yielding to a partly sunny afternoon with highs only reaching around 26, as brisk winds persist.\n\nThe appearance outdoors is certainly brisk and raw, not ideal for leisurely strolls by the beach. Lake Michigan likely churns with notable wave activity, agitated by the ongoing winds, making any water-related activities less than favorable. With temperatures typical for late November in the Midwest, it\u2019s advisable to don warm layers, including a heavy coat, gloves, and a hat, to ward off the biting chill that settles into the bones. Given the conditions, indoor pursuits such as visiting local museums or enjoying a warm caf\u00e9 may be more enticing than venturing out into the wintery landscape.",
