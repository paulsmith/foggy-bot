    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the air is feeling quite crisp and cool today, with current temperatures in the mid 30s and a notable wind creating a somewhat blustery atmosphere. The mostly cloudy sky offers patchy clarity, as the usual blue stretches are obscured. As we look ahead, the afternoon promises to remain cloudy, with the temperature edging only slightly higher, peaking close to 39 degrees. As night approaches, expect the likelihood of snowfall increasing after midnight, with an anticipated low around freezing, making for a potentially wintry evening.\n\nGiven the chilly air and overcast conditions, it may not be the most inviting day to spend outdoors by the beach. The lake remains relatively calm today, and with gusty winds shaking the shoreline, visiting may still provide a picturesque winter scene, but it's advisable to dress warmly. A winter coat, hat, and gloves will ensure you stay comfortable. While this temperature is typical for mid-December in the Midwest, the impending snowfall adds a nice touch of seasonal charm. If you're considering activities today, a cozy time indoors with a warm beverage might be preferable, especially with the approaching weather shift marking the arrival of winter's full embrace.",
