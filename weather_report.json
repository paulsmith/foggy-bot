    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston paint a chilly picture as temperatures hover in the mid 30s, combined with a blustery wind sweeping in from the west northwest. The sky is predominantly cloudy, lending a somewhat gloomy ambiance to the scene. As for precipitation, no rain or snow is anticipated at this hour, allowing for drier air to prevail. \n\nLooking ahead to Tuesday, expect mostly cloudy skies to dominate, with high temperatures struggling to reach the mid 30s before settling back into the low 30s by afternoon. Winds will remain gentle, but may kick up at times, creating a brisk atmosphere that might feel even colder. Dress warmly if venturing outside; layers, hats, and gloves will be wise companions given the season's chilly character. Though typical for December in this part of the world, the weather may deter outdoor activities like walks along the beach or park visits. Instead, consider indoor options such as a cozy caf\u00e9 or visiting local shops as the holidays approach, and embrace the tranquility of the winter season.",
