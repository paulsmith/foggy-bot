    "weather_report": "This evening in Evanston, the atmosphere feels cool and somewhat breezy, settling into the low 50s, accompanied by a feeling of crispness in the air. The wind is moderately spirited, out of the southeast, bringing a bit of a chill, and the sky appears mostly cloudy, wrapped in a gloomy shroud typical of late fall. As night descends, those clouds will likely usher in mild temperatures as they drop to around 49 degrees. \n\nTomorrow's forecast indicates a shift, as rain showers are predicted to roll in after noon, matched with a high near 62 degrees. The wind will pick up slightly, with gusts reaching up to 30 mph, enhancing that refreshing fall briskness. The likelihood of rain at 60% suggests that any outdoor plans may need an umbrella, particularly as the temperatures begin to dip later in the day. For a comfortable outing, layering up with a light jacket is advisable, considering the season's transition into cooler weather. Given the late hour and overcast skies, this might not be the most inviting time for a beach stroll, but it could be an ideal opportunity to cozy up indoors or sip a warm beverage while watching the wind whip the lake into a tangy froth.",
