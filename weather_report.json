    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather is marked by crisp and cool conditions, with temperatures hovering in the mid-20s and a gentle west wind creating a noticeably blustery atmosphere. As you gaze towards Lake Michigan, the scene reveals a partly cloudy sky, but expect brighter moments as the afternoon unfolds into sunnier intervals. Tonight, temperatures will dip to the low teens, accompanied by a sharp wind chill that could feel as frigid as -2. \n\nThe lake is relatively calm for this time of year, with mild wave action, though the chill and calmness might deter beachgoers. There's no precipitation on the horizon, making it a dry outing. Those venturing outdoors should warmly bundle up in layers, including a heavy coat, scarf, and mittens, to combat the cold. Given the season, these temperatures are typical for late November in the Midwest, setting the stage for winter activities. As the sun sets early, enjoy a brisk walk along the shore or perhaps a cozy evening indoors, ideal for reflecting on the upcoming holiday season.",
