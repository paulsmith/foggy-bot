    "weather_report": "As the brisk air settles over Evanston, the current conditions reveal a cool, slightly damp ambiance with temperatures lingering in the upper 40s, accompanied by moderate humidity that adds a touch of chill. The clouds hang thick in the sky, creating a somber backdrop against the inviting stretch of Lake Michigan, where gentle waves ripple toward the shore under a fierce southeast breeze. Expecting a shift this afternoon, rain is likely to commence after 5 PM, with a high near the mid-50s forecasted. The wind will remain gusty, channeling bursts that may reach up to 25 miles per hour.\n\nWith today's weather tipping toward the murky side, it may not offer the most pleasant atmosphere for outdoor activities. However, those who appreciate the serenity of an overcast beach should find the scene appealing, despite the impending precipitation. Given the cooler temperatures and the forecasted rain, layering up is advisable\u2014consider donning a warm jacket, perhaps a hat, and waterproof footwear as conditions shift toward a wet evening. The current season in early November typically ushers in colder weather, and today's temperatures align closely with seasonal expectations. If you're keen to venture out, a brisk walk along the beach could be refreshing, as long as you're prepared for the forecasted showers later on in the day.",
