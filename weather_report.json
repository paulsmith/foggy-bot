    "weather_report": "The current weather in Evanston, Illinois, feels decidedly frigid, with temperatures hovering in the mid-single digits. The air is crisp and somewhat biting, heightened by a brisk wind that adds to the chill factor. Conditions outside are clear, providing an unobstructed view of the night sky over Lake Michigan. As we move overnight, expect mostly clear skies with temperatures inching up slightly, though wind chills could dip as low as -7, making it a night best spent indoors.\n\nLooking ahead to Friday, sunshine will break through as temperatures climb into the low 20s, though wind chill could again feel as cold as -8 due to gentle breezes shifting southwest. There is no precipitation in the forecast, ensuring a dry day for anyone wishing to venture outside. However, dress warmly, layering up to combat the cold, and remember that the chill can linger particularly in shaded areas or along the lakeshore. Given that this is late January, temperatures are typical for this time of year in the Midwest, and outdoor activities should be limited to brisk walks or short outings. Residents may want to stay cozy indoors as we anticipate another winter day with plenty of wintery charm but decidedly unpleasant conditions for prolonged outdoor enjoyment.",
