    "weather_report": "Evanston wakes up to a chilly morning, with temperatures resting in the mid-30s and a gentle breeze stirring from the west. The sky is overcast, casting a gray hue across the lakefront as clouds obscure what may usually be a bright and inviting shoreline. Expect the weather today to maintain this cloudy demeanor, with temperatures inching upward to the upper 30s later in the day. Winds will shift to a light westward direction, creating a more soothing atmosphere compared to the howling gusts felt earlier. As night approaches, prepare for snow, likely after midnight, with a moderate chance of precipitation.\n\nGiven these conditions, it would be wise to don warm layers\u2014perhaps a cozy coat, a woolen hat, and sturdy boots\u2014as the chill lingers, particularly with the added potential for snow accumulation. Typical for this time of year in the Midwest, such winter weather can often feel biting and brisk. Any thoughts of outdoor activities should be tempered by the impending snowfall, perhaps favoring indoor pursuits such as visiting local cafes or taking in a museum exhibit. Today, as we approach the festive holiday season, the atmosphere resonates with a tranquil winter beauty, though one best appreciated from the warmth of indoors.",
