    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks in Evanston, the air carries a crisp chill with temperatures resting in the mid-30s. The atmosphere is dense with a thick layer of clouds overhead, lending a gloomy yet tranquil feel to the winter morning. Wind gusts are fierce, whipping from the west, creating a biting sensation that underscores the cool conditions. Lake Michigan's waves may reflect this brisk energy, likely making for a somewhat tumultuous surface.\n\nLooking ahead to the day, temperatures are expected to rise only slightly, peaking in the upper 30s, while the skies remain largely overcast. Winds will shift to a gentler breeze, allowing for a bit more comfort despite the lingering chill. No precipitation is anticipated, making it a dry day overall, albeit far from inviting. With the current seasonal temperatures typical of December in the Midwest, it suggests a classic winter ambiance.\n\nGiven these conditions, layering is essential; an insulated jacket along with a hat and gloves would provide much-needed warmth while outdoors. The weather might deter long outings but offers an opportunity for serene walks along the lakefront, where the striking interplay of waves can be an inspiration for those willing to brave the cold. Today, residents are reminded to enjoy the calm before the holiday bustle reaches its peak.",
