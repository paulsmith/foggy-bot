    "weather_report": "This evening in Evanston, the temperature hovers just below freezing in the low 20s, accompanied by light snow and a sweeping blanket of fog. The air feels sharp and cold, with a distinctly brisk ambiance enhanced by the dampness that clings to the skin. Looking ahead, the forecast predicts a continuing embrace of winter tonight, with more snow and scattered flurries expected. As temperatures plunge to the mid-teens, wind chill will bite, potentially dipping as low as -5, driven by a howling northwesterly wind gusting aggressively at times.\n\nThough the icy air may deter most outdoor adventures, it might appeal to those keen on experiencing a true winter atmosphere. However, for any planned activities, bundling up with layers including a sturdy coat, gloves, and a thick scarf is essential. The beach, while looking serene under the foggy twilight, is likely too tentative for swimming, with wave conditions reflecting the winter's chill. This night marks an ordinary day without any major holidays approaching, making it perfect for cozing up indoors with a warm beverage rather than engaging with the elements outside.",
