    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston are brisk, with temperatures in the mid-20s and a stirring breeze that is both invigorating and chilly. The air feels crisp and clear, making it an excellent evening for a quiet stroll along the beach, albeit bundled up to ward off the cold. As we move into the night, expect clear skies with a low in the low 20s, accompanied by a gentle breeze from the west-southwest that will ease up later. \n\nTomorrow promises a shift as temperatures peak in the mid-40s, gradually dropping to the low 40s in the afternoon, with winds picking up the pace, potentially reaching howling speeds. The day will be mostly sunny, presenting an inviting scene perfect for outdoor activities. However, the pristine clarity of the night will contrast with strong gusts capable of making the waterfront feel even brisker, so warm layers will be necessary to ensure comfort. Given that we are deep into winter, these temperatures are quite typical for Evanston, suggesting a perfect setting to embrace the chilly season\u2014ideal for winter walks or even some brisk beachcombing, if you're adventurous enough.",
