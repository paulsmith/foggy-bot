    "weather_report": "Current weather conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly and blustery atmosphere with temperatures hovering in the upper 30s, creating a crisp and cool environment. As the day unfolds, residents can expect scattered snow showers this afternoon, with overcast skies and the temperatures dipping further to the mid 30s. A fierce west wind is at play, gusting up to 50 miles per hour, emphasizing the cold feel of the day, and contributing to noticeable wind chill values falling into the single digits by nightfall.\n\nThe evening will bring more scattered snow showers, tapering off before dawn, with temperatures sinking to around the low teens. Accumulation from these flurries is expected to be minimal. Given the wintry conditions, the beach may appear less inviting, and the rough waters of Lake Michigan will likely reflect the tumultuous winds, potentially creating hazardous conditions for any ventures near the shore. As for attire, layering is crucial; individuals should opt for warm jackets, hats, and gloves to stave off the biting cold. This weather does align with typical early December temperatures for the region, reminding us that winter is firmly upon us. While indoor activities might be more appealing today, a brisk walk, bundled up well, could still be refreshing. Notably, while December holiday cheer is near, today itself is not marked by any significant celebrations.",
