    "weather_report": "Evanston is experiencing a brisk winter day with temperatures in the low 30s, accompanied by a moderately humid chill that bites at exposed skin. The skies are mostly overcast, casting a dull light over the beach as the winds dance fiercely from the east at nearly 50 mph, creating a wild atmosphere along the shores of Lake Michigan. The chilly air is set to give rise to patchy fog later, with snow anticipated just after midnight, potentially leading to slight accumulation.\n\nFor those venturing outdoors today, it\u2019s advisable to dress warmly, favoring insulated layers and wind-resistant outerwear to combat the blustery conditions. Throughout the day, the temperature will hover around the mid-30s, typical for early February in this region. As for activities, it might be best to stay cozy indoors, perhaps indulging in warm drinks or settling in with a book, as the blustery weather and likelihood of precipitation do little to invite outdoor adventures.",
