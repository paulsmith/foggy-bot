    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston paint a chilly and somewhat dreary picture. With temperatures hovering in the low 20s, the air feels crisp and cold, especially as light snow continues to fall gently. The day remains clouded, with limited visibility over Lake Michigan, contrasting with the vibrant summer images that the beach typically evokes. \n\nLooking ahead, the forecast suggests a slight chance of snow showers continuing into the afternoon, with temperatures expected to rise only marginally to around the mid-20s. A northeast breeze adds to the chill, and tonight, snow showers are likely to return, increasing the chances of accumulation. While the waves may not be fierce, they do create a bracing ambiance, reflecting the winter's rhythm rather than summer's gentle lapping. Given the current conditions, dressing warmly in layers with a good winter coat, maybe a scarf and gloves, will be essential for anyone venturing outside. The temperatures align with the expectation for this time of year in the Midwest, confirming the familiarity of winter's grip. As for activities, a cozy evening indoors or a brisk walk along the lake to enjoy the snowfall could be quite refreshing.",
