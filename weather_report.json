    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the current conditions present a chilly scene with temperatures hovering in the mid-30s, accompanied by a blustery wind that stirs up the lake\u2019s surface, creating a roiling effect on waters that reflect the overcast skies. As rain sets in this afternoon, the prospect of drizzly conditions and patchy fog looms large, leading to a definitive forecast of wet weather, with the chance of significant rainfall peaking at 100% tonight. The cold, damp air may feel more uncomfortable due to the wind's bite, making it advisable to bundle up.\n\nGiven the continuing presence of rain and gusty winds, activities outdoors might be best avoided unless one is prepared for less-than-ideal weather. A visit to a museum or a cozy caf\u00e9 would suit this grey December day, typical for this time of year in the Midwest. For those venturing outside, waterproof attire is essential, along with a warm layer to fend off the chill. In this season, temperatures are in line with expectations for mid-December, where cold and damp frequently accompany cloudy skies in Evanston.",
