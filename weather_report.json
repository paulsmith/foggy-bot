    "weather_report": "Current weather conditions in Evanston present a chilly scene with a stubborn fog hanging over the area, reducing visibility and casting a misty shroud over Lake Michigan. The temperature rests in the low 40s, accompanied by a brisk wind that adds an edge to the cool atmosphere. This afternoon, residents can expect patchy fog to persist, with cloud cover dominating the sky while the mercury barely nudges up toward the mid 40s. Tonight, the fog may intensify, bringing a slight chance of rain showers, creating a damp and overcast ambiance as temperatures hover around the low 40s.\n\nThe beaches may appear less inviting today, with the mist enveloping the shoreline and causing conditions to feel dismal rather than refreshing. Wave activity should be relatively calm, making it a challenging day for any water activities. In light of the weather, dressing warmly in layers will be crucial; a thick jacket, perhaps a scarf, and sturdy shoes are recommended as one navigates the chilly, murky air. This mid-December day fits within the seasonal expectations for the region, although the pervasive fog and potential rain might just dampen spirits. It may not be the best time for outdoor excursions, but a cozy indoor activity like visiting a local caf\u00e9 or reading a book by the window could be an inviting alternative.",
