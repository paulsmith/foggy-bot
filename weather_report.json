    "weather_report": "As night settles over Evanston, the weather is best described as cool and somewhat blustery with temperatures hovering in the low 50s. The air carries a slightly damp chill, corresponding to the relatively high humidity, and the breeze is quite vigorous, shifting from the west, which may feel brisk against the skin. The sky is cloaked in clouds, contributing to an overall muted appearance of the landscape, especially as one looks towards Lake Michigan. Unfortunately, there is no precipitation anticipated tonight, allowing for a dry evening despite the pervasive overcast.\n\nLooking ahead to Veterans Day, a more promising forecast emerges with mostly sunny skies expected, although temperatures will drop to the mid-40s by the afternoon. The winds will continue to be strong, which may create a notable wind chill. Given this transition, layering will be advisable to comfortably enjoy outdoor activities. As for suggested activities, tonight lends itself to cozy indoor pursuits; perhaps a warm drink at a local caf\u00e9 would be delightful. Tomorrow, with improved conditions, a stroll along the lake or a visit to one of Evanston's parks could be refreshing, especially with the sun illuminating the vibrant autumn foliage. With thoughtful attire and a spirit for exploration, the weekend ahead could be splendid.",
