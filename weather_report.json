    "weather_report": "Currently in Evanston, the temperature hovers in the low 40s, cloaked in a damp chill enhanced by overcast skies. The ambiance is cool and yet still, evoking a sense of tranquility along the shoreline of Lake Michigan, though it carries the weight of impending rain. As we look ahead, the overnight hours suggest a slight chance of rain before dawn, with temperatures dipping to around 44, complemented by a whispering northeast wind that may stir up a few leaves, reaching a brisk gustiness at times.\n\nTuesday promises a shift towards a more favorable outlook, with partly sunny skies breaking through as the day progresses, and temperatures climbing into the upper 40s. While the air maintains a crisp edge, the anticipated easing of cloud cover may breathe a fresh vibrancy into the landscape. Given the current season, these temperatures are fairly typical for mid-November in this region, hinting at the nearing winter chill. For those venturing out, light layers and a cozy jacket are advisable to fend off the coolness, particularly near the lakefront, which could be amplified by any leftover gusts. As for activities, a stroll along the beach may yield serene views and the invigorating scent of the lake, though those hoping to engage in water sports should take heed of the chilly conditions.",
