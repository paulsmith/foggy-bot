    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois, showcase a wintry scene with temperatures hovering in the low 30s. The air feels cold, invigorated by a blustery wind that sweeps across the beach, curling through tree branches and carrying the scent of fresh snow. Overhead, a thick blanket of clouds casts a muted light over the landscape, creating a stark contrast against the steel-grey waters of Lake Michigan, where gentle waves lap at the shore. \n\nAs the day progresses, expect a chance of snow showers, with the mercury dipping later in the afternoon to near 22 degrees. With gusty winds continuing to howl at 15 to 25 miles per hour, it\u2019s advisable to bundle up in warm layers, emphasizing hats, gloves, and insulated coats to stave off the biting chill, which may feel as frigid as -14 with the wind chill. The chance of new snow accumulation could lead to about an inch later on, adding to the wintery atmosphere. This weather reflects a typical December day for the region, where such cold and snow are seasonally expected. For those keen on outdoor activities, consider a brisk walk along the shore, though be mindful of the cold and perhaps save more strenuous endeavors for another day.",
