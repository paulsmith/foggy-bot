    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently shrouded in a wintry chill, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s, creating a brisk atmosphere that's intensified by gusty winds from the west-northwest. The clouds linger overhead, casting a muted gray pallor across the landscape, and while the lake appears relatively calm, the chilly air suggests a certain bite that may deter casual strolls along the shore. This afternoon, expect similar conditions to persist, with a high near the mid-30s and only a slight easing in the relentless breeze.\n\nAs night approaches, temperatures will dip to the mid-20s, maintaining a decidedly wintry disposition. The weather presents an unpleasant appearance with gray skies dominating, leaving little room for sunshine. There\u2019s no precipitation expected to disrupt outdoor plans today, so while it's not ideal for beach outings, bundled walks along the shore or visits to nearby caf\u00e9s could provide a warm refuge from the chill. Given this season\u2019s typical temperatures, layering up with insulated jackets, hats, and scarves is particularly advisable to combat the wind and cold.",
