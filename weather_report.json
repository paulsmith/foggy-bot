    "weather_report": "As we look at the current weather in Evanston, the air is quite cold and the sky is adorned with scattered clouds, offering a mostly clear view of the day. Temperatures hover in the mid-20s, creating a crisp and cool atmosphere enhanced by a fierce wind from the northwest at about 45 mph, causing a biting chill as it bites at exposed skin. This afternoon, expect a shift as cloud cover increases, with temperatures dipping slightly and a high near the upper 20s. Tonight brings a transition to partly cloudy skies with a low settling into the mid-teens, accompanied by a gentler breeze.\n\nWhile no precipitation is in sight, the wave conditions on Lake Michigan likely show some choppy surfaces due to the strong winds disrupting the water's calm, inviting caution for those considering activities on the shore. For those venturing outdoors, layering with insulated clothing and windbreakers is recommended, as the combination of cold air and vigorous gusts can lead to an uncomfortably frigid experience. The current temperatures are typical for early December in this region, suggesting winter is well underway. If you're contemplating the great outdoors, a stroll along the beach or a brisk walk in nearby parks could be invigorating, just be prepared for the chill. This day finds itself nestled in the heart of the holiday season, with festive cheer around the corner, adding a touch of warmth to the prevailing cold.",
