    "weather_report": "The current weather in Evanston paints a chilly and misty picture, with temperatures lingering in the mid-30s and a heavy fog that softens the surroundings. The air is dense and damp, offering a feeling that is noticeably brisk and cool, as gusts whisper in from the southeast at a gentle pace. As we look ahead, the forecast indicates a modest improvement, suggesting the fog will dissipate by mid-morning, giving way to partly sunny skies and a high reaching into the upper 40s. Tonight, however, expect a shift towards cloudy conditions with light drizzle possible, particularly in the evening hours.\n\nAs for wave conditions on Lake Michigan, they are likely subdued, reflecting the calm winds, making for a serene vista despite the dull light. With precipitation chances at 50% this evening, it would be prudent to carry an umbrella for any outdoor plans. Given the current season, these temperatures are typical for late November in the Midwest, where one should dress warmly, favoring layers, including a sturdy coat, gloves, and perhaps a scarf to fend off the chill. Ideal activities might include a brisk walk along the shore, taking in the muted tranquility of the lake, or perhaps enjoying a warm drink at a nearby caf\u00e9, soaking in the ambiance as the holiday season approaches.",
