Tomorrow promises mostly sunny skies with temperatures reaching the upper 20s, though it\u2019s anticipated that the cold will linger in the afternoon.\n\nThe beach, under the moonlight, has an expansive, tranquil beauty, unmarred by precipitation. The scene is certainly more pleasant than unpleasant, though anyone venturing outside will require warm clothing to fend off the biting cold. Waves on Lake Michigan will likely reflect the brisk winds\u2014a reminder of winter's approach. This time of year typically sees temperatures in the seasonally low range, so the current chill aligns with expectations for late November.\n\nFor those looking to embrace the season, bundled outdoor activities like brisk walks along the shoreline or simply enjoying the scenery may suit the day. Remember to dress warmly\u2014layers, insulated jackets, and hats are highly recommended. Though today isn't a holiday, the festive spirit of the season is palpable, with the joy of celebrations on the horizon.",
