    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a cool evening marked by a light chill, with temperatures hovering in the low 50s and a brisk wind creating a blustery atmosphere. The sky is mostly clear right now, although the forecast indicates that clouds will soon envelop the area, leading to a chance of rain later in the night. As we move into overnight hours, temperatures are expected to dip into the low 40s, rising slightly as we approach dawn. With gusts reaching up to 20 mph, the wind adds a refreshing edge to the air, but it might feel slightly raw for those venturing outside.\n\nFor Wednesday, expect scattered rain showers in the morning, giving way to a partly sunny afternoon with temperatures peaking in the upper 40s before falling again. The day\u2019s high temperatures are typical for this time of year as we transition deeper into fall, signaling the approach of winter. The beach might see some moderate wave conditions, particularly with the ongoing winds, which could lead to a slightly choppy Lake Michigan. Given the cool, damp environment, layered clothing is recommended\u2014think a warm jacket and comfortable footwear, ideally waterproof if venturing by the water. With the impending rain and cooler temperatures, outdoor activities should be limited; however, a brisk walk along the lakefront or a cozy day indoors might be just the ticket to enjoy the beauty of the season.",
