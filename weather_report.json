    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current scene is chilly and somewhat damp, with a temperature in the mid-30s. The atmosphere is thick and heavy, characteristic of an overcast night, with the wind blustering from the northwest at a vigorous pace. The shore of Lake Michigan is mostly calm, but conditions could lead to some gentle waves as the wind stirs the water. Looking ahead, the overnight forecast suggests a slight chance of rain transitioning to patchy drizzle, and temperatures are set to dip into the low 40s. Expect a cloudy day on Friday with highs reaching the upper 40s, while gusty winds will continue to whip through the area.\n\nFor outdoor enthusiasts, this isn\u2019t the most inviting weather to spend significant time outdoors; the conditions may feel raw and unwelcoming. Nevertheless, a brisk walk along the beach could invigorate as long as one is suitably dressed\u2014think warm layers and a waterproof jacket. Given that we are in late November, these temperatures align closely with typical seasonal averages for the region, evoking a sense of early winter settling in. While today is not a major holiday, Thanksgiving is just around the corner, heightening the anticipation of holiday gatherings and festivities ahead.",
