    "weather_report": "Currently in Evanston, temperatures hover in the upper single digits, enveloping the area in a brisk chill, accentuated by gusty winds sweeping down from the north. While the skies are clear, the biting cold makes it feel significantly lower; indeed, the wind adds an extra layer of sharpness to the atmosphere, creating a decidedly wintry scene at this hour. As we look forward to Friday, the forecast holds a promise of partly sunny skies, with daytime highs creeping into the upper 20s, though wind chills may still flirt with the freezing mark.\n\nTonight and into the early morning, expect mostly clear skies, ideal for stargazing if you\u2019re braving the cold. By day, with wave conditions calm along the shoreline of Lake Michigan, the picturesque view remains inviting, though the cold might deter most from a leisurely stroll. Attire should lean towards heavy winter garb\u2014think thick coats, warm hats, and gloves\u2014if you plan to venture outside, especially given the seasonal chill typical for mid-December in this region. It's a day best suited for indoor activities, perhaps catching up on holiday preparations or enjoying a warm beverage at home, as the tranquil yet frigid ambiance outside paints a picture of a serene winter night.",
