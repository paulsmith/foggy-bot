    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston paint a brisk picture, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s and a chilled breeze creating a sense of winter's presence. The lakefront reveals a rough surf under a dreary, overcast sky, setting a somber tone as the landscape stretches towards Lake Michigan. With wind gusts whipping through, one might describe it as quite blustery, making it feel even cooler as the day progresses. As Thanksgiving Day unfolds, isolated snow showers are expected this afternoon, although the likelihood of significant accumulation remains modest. \n\nFor those venturing outside later today, an ensemble of warm layers is advisable to combat the biting wind and potential snowfall. Given the chilly and damp conditions, it's best to bundle up well before heading out. While the weather might not be ideal for leisurely beach strolls, indoor activities fit for the season are recommended. With Thanksgiving festivities just around the corner, this cooling stretch marks a classic late November chill that encourages cozy gatherings and warm comfort foods.",
