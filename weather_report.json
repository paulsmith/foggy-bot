    "weather_report": "In Evanston, current conditions present a chilly and damp atmosphere, with temperatures lingering in the low 40s and a fierce wind making its presence known. The air is thick and heavy, contributing to a rather murky visibility, particularly near the beach as one looks toward the restless waters of Lake Michigan. The forecast suggests an overnight low around the high 30s, with a slow rise to the low 40s expected, coupled with patchy fog that may linger into Monday morning. Rain showers are possible, but minimal accumulation is anticipated.\n\nToday, expect a cloudy disposition with areas of fog hanging persistently, underscored by a 20% chance of light rain. The temperature is predicted to hover around the high 40s, eventually dipping as the day progresses. It may feel a bit dreary outside, prompting a recommendation for warm and waterproof attire if venturing out, particularly for those hoping to explore the beach. Wave conditions are likely a bit restless, reflecting the gusty winds that may disrupt any peaceful shoreline strolls. These wintery conditions are typical for mid-December in this region, where chilly temperatures and moisture can often make for a damp and uncomfortable setting. While outdoor activities may be limited due to the weather, cozying up with a good book or enjoying a warm beverage indoors could provide a comforting escape from the chill.",
