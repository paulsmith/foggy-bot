    "weather_report": "This morning in Evanston, the atmosphere is marked by a damp chill, with temperatures in the low 50s complemented by a nearly saturated air that feels cool and penetrating. A gentle wind whispers from the east, adding a crisp edge to the already somber scene of light drizzle and fog. The beach, usually a vibrant canvas, presents a muted palette today, shrouded in mist and gray clouds that blanket the horizon.\n\nAs we look ahead to the day, we can expect widespread drizzle and lingering rain showers through the morning hours. The high will peak in the mid 50s, with temperatures dipping slightly in the afternoon as the clouds persist. A gentle breeze will pick up later, possibly turning blustery, and there\u2019s a noticeable 70% chance of additional rain, accumulating less than a tenth of an inch by day's end. Given this forecast, those venturing outside should don waterproof jackets and footwear, as puddles and wet pathways are likely. The current weather, typical for mid-November in the Midwest, may deter some outdoor enthusiasm but can still provide a moody beauty worth embracing. While this day is not a holiday, the approach of Thanksgiving in the coming weeks offers a reminder of seasonal gatherings, making one appreciate the cozy comforts of home during this cold, drizzly weather.",
