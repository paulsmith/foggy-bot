    "weather_report": "As the night settles over Evanston, temperatures hover around the mid 30s, contributing to a crisp and cool atmosphere. The air is thick with moisture, creating an almost still sensation by the lake as low clouds envelop the horizon. Wind from the southwest gently stirs at about five miles per hour, adding a subtle chill to the evening. Currently, it\u2019s cloudy with no precipitation expected, although patchy fog may drift in, particularly as overnight temperatures dip to slightly below freezing. \n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, residents can anticipate a chilly morning that gives way to a partly sunny afternoon, with highs reaching into the low 50s. Fog may linger until mid-morning, but as the sun breaks through, conditions will feel more pleasant, albeit mixed with a slight chill. Given the season, these temperatures are typical for late November in Illinois, offering a seasonal feel conducive to cozy indoor gatherings. However, for those venturing outdoors, layers are advisable\u2014think a warm sweater or light jacket paired with a hat to fend off the cooling breeze. The calming waters of Lake Michigan may present gentle waves, inviting a peaceful stroll along the shore or a quiet moment to breathe in the fresh, invigorating air. As this day unfolds, take advantage of the outdoors while relishing the final days of November before the holiday season truly descends upon us.",
