    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Evanston, the air hangs heavy and cool, currently around the mid 30s with a touch of moisture that lends the morning a crisp, damp quality. Winds are fierce, blowing in from the northwest at a strong clip, creating a notable chill that may make it feel even cooler as you venture outside. The view of the beach presents a partly cloudy sky, but no immediate precipitation is evident\u2014though patchy drizzle is expected overnight.\n\nLooking ahead to the day, clouds will dominate the sky, providing a somber backdrop as temperatures rise slightly into the high 40s before dipping again in the afternoon. The gusty winds will persist, making it a classic blustery day along the shores of Lake Michigan, stirring the waves and creating a brisk atmosphere that feels entirely typical for late November in this region. Given the conditions, it would be wise to dress warmly with layers, accompanied by a windbreaker to shield against the gusts. \n\nWith Thanksgiving just around the corner, this day indeed carries a holiday spirit, albeit a chilly one. Outdoor activities may be best limited to brief walks, perhaps to enjoy the shoreline's beauty, but be sure to keep moving to stay comfortable in the cold. So, whether you\u2019re strolling along the beach or preparing for the holiday festivities, be prepared for brisk conditions that remind us winter is on its way.",
