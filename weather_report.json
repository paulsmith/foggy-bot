    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a brisk evening, with temperatures hovering in the mid 30s and a gentle breeze from the south. The air feels crisp and cool, typical for late February in this part of the Midwest. As we look ahead, tonight\u2019s skies are expected to be mostly cloudy, dipping to around 34 degrees, while the southwest winds may pick up slightly, gusting to 25 mph. \n\nTomorrow, the clouds will persist, with highs approaching the low 50s before settling back into the mid 40s in the afternoon. This fluctuation in temperature aligns well with the expectations for this season; however, the dryness is a welcome contrast to the potential dampness lurking in the air. Although there\u2019s no immediate threat of precipitation, the wave conditions at Lake Michigan may be choppy with the blustery winds. It might be a good day for a brisk walk along the shoreline, but consider layering up with a comfortable jacket to fend off the chill. Late February is certainly no time to be caught without protection from the elements, as warmer attire will help navigate the ebb and flow of an early spring on the horizon.",
