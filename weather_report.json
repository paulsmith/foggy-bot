    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current conditions are marked by a clammy embrace, with temperatures lingering in the low 60s and humidity saturating the air. The atmosphere is heavy with impending rain, as blustery winds from the south howl at around 20 mph, contributing to an overall damp and cool feel. Looking ahead, the forecast invites a night filled with rain showers and a continuation of clouds, with overnight lows remaining steady. Tomorrow promises more of the same\u2014a murky day with scattered rain, highs inching towards the mid-60s, and gusts that could reach a fierce 45 mph.\n\nToday\u2019s appearance is decidedly unpleasant, with overcast skies and the likelihood of rain, making outdoor adventures seem less appealing. The churning waters of Lake Michigan may present heightened waves, creating a potentially dramatic scene, but also uninviting conditions for beachgoers or boaters. With heavy precipitation on the horizon, it\u2019s advisable to dress warmly in layered, waterproof clothing and sturdy shoes. While November in the Midwest typically ushers in cooler temperatures, the persistent humidity adds a unique chill, reminding us that winter is just around the corner. Given the late hour and the forecast, indoor activities such as visiting local caf\u00e9s or museums would be more fitting for today\u2019s weather.",
