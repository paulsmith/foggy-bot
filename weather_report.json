    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current atmosphere is decidedly chilly, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s and a blustery wind adding a bite to the air. Overhead, a canopy of clouds blankets the sky, casting a muted light over the chilly scene, while the restless waters of Lake Michigan show hints of whitecaps stirred by the gusty conditions. As Thanksgiving Day unfolds, expect the air to remain brisk with a few isolated snow showers anticipated later in the afternoon. While the high is projected to reach just above freezing, the temperatures will dip in the evening, leading to a cold night with intermittent snow flurries.\n\nGiven these conditions, the beach may appear more somber than inviting, with the waves crashing against the shore\u2014a visual reminder of winter's impending grip. For those venturing outside, layered clothing is advisable: a warm coat, gloves, and perhaps a knitted hat to fend off the chill. While traditional outdoor activities may be curtailed, a scenic walk along the shore can still be a refreshing experience\u2014just be prepared for the possible light snow and brisk winds. On this notable day of gathering for Thanksgiving, many may find comfort indoors, but the beauty of the lake against a storied sky still offers a unique, albeit wintry, charm.",
