    "weather_report": "Currently in Evanston, the weather is marked by a humid atmosphere and a gentle breeze, as temperatures sit in the mid-60s. The skies are overcast, lending a gray pallor to the evening and foreshadowing moisture. As the night draws on, the forecast indicates rain and a chance of thunderstorms, with temperatures dipping slightly to the low 60s. Wind will pick up, becoming more brisk, leading to gusts that could reach up to 25 mph, making conditions feel a bit more unsettled.\n\nLooking ahead to Tuesday, expect persistent showers and thunderstorms, with temperatures peaking around the mid-60s \u2013 cooler than today, particularly as the afternoon approaches. The winds will be quite spirited, with gusts potentially reaching 45 mph, creating choppy wave conditions on Lake Michigan. With the likelihood of rain, especially given the 70% chance of precipitation, it might be best to stay indoors unless you're prepared with rain gear. Given the season, this weather aligns with typical fall patterns, though the humidity may feel a touch oppressive. A warm, waterproof jacket is advisable if venturing out, and indoor activities such as visiting local cafes or museums could provide a cozy alternative on this blustery day.",
