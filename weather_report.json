    "weather_report": "As night settles over Evanston, a chill embraces the air, with temperatures dipping toward 42 degrees. The sky is mostly clear, inviting a peaceful gaze at the stars, while a gentle south-southeast wind whispers at around 5 miles per hour. The tranquillity of the beach scene beckons to those who appreciate the calmness of a late autumn evening, although it may feel a touch brisk for those unprepared. \n\nTomorrow brings a reprieve in the form of sunshine, anticipated to warm the day to a pleasant 58 degrees. With the sun shining brightly and a moderate southeasterly breeze expected to pick up a bit, outdoor activities could flourish. The lake may display some light wave action but generally appears calm, perfect for a reflective stroll along the shore or perhaps an outing with a good book. As the season naturally cools, dressing in layers\u2014perhaps a light jacket paired with comfortable pants\u2014will keep one cozy while enjoying the fresh air. With no significant precipitation forecasted, the day may serve as a delightful opportunity to savor the outdoor beauty of Lake Michigan, engaging in leisurely activities or simple reflections by the water's edge.",
