    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather reveals a brisk and slightly cool afternoon, with temperatures in the low 50s and a gentle yet noticeable breeze from the east. The humidity imparts a refreshing quality to the air, making it feel invigorating despite the chill. Clear skies punctuate the mostly sunny day, with just a hint of clouds mingling high above, providing a picturesque view towards Lake Michigan. However, the wind is notably gusty, creating lively wave conditions along the shore. \n\nAs we move into the later hours, expect partly cloudy skies to settle in, with temperatures dipping down to the low 40s. The evening\u2019s winds will continue from the southeast, making for a chilling night. With no precipitation expected throughout the day or night, outdoor activities remain on the table. Given the season, these temperatures are typical for November in the Midwest, presenting an opportunity for warm layers. It\u2019s advisable to dress in comfortable, layered clothing to fully enjoy the late autumn feel. A stroll along the beach or through local parks could be particularly pleasant, especially under such inviting, clear conditions, as we embrace the season's natural beauty.",
