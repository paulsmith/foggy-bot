    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently experiencing crisp and cool conditions, with overcast skies contributing to a somewhat dreary atmosphere. The temperature hovers in the low 30s, and the brisk winds whisper from the northwest, creating a biting chill that may have you reaching for your warmest coat. As we look ahead, today's weather is expected to remain cloudy with a high around the mid 30s, gradually dropping to the mid 20s tonight, maintaining a light and steady breeze.\n\nWith the lake nearby, wave conditions should be relatively calm, given the current light winds, but the water might reflect the muted gray of the sky, lacking the vibrant hues typical on clearer days. As there\u2019s no precipitation forecasted today, outdoor plans may proceed without worry, though the brisk air suggests dressing in layers\u2014think a sturdy winter coat, warm gloves, and perhaps a cozy hat. As we approach the heart of December, these temperatures are typical for the season in this region, creating a true wintry feel. Given the conditions, a leisurely stroll along the beach or a visit to nearby cafes could provide a nice escape for anyone wanting to embrace the local winter atmosphere without straying too far from warmth.",
