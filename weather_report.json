    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the current conditions reflect a brisk late-night atmosphere, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s and a blanket of moisture lending a damp chill to the air, making it feel even colder. As we look toward the morning, mostly cloudy skies will prevail, with temperatures creeping slightly upwards to around 30 before dawn, accompanied by a gentle, whispering breeze from the north-northeast that could pick up in strength. Saturday is set to greet residents with partly sunny skies, offering a bit of warmth as the high reaches the mid 30s\u2014a modest yet pleasant improvement over the previous day. \n\nWith no precipitation expected, the conditions for outdoor activities remain favorable, though the cool air may compel those venturing out to dress warmly. Waves along Lake Michigan can be expected to be a bit restless, providing a brisk seaside spectacle. This winter chill is typical for this time of year in the Midwest, where crisp, chilly air is the signature of February. Thus, a stable and hearty approach to layering, perhaps integrating a snug coat and warm hat, will enhance comfort for any weekend outings, whether at the beach admiring the fading winter light or engaging in local errands.",
