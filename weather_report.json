    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the current conditions paint a chilly picture with temperatures hovering in the low 30s, complemented by a brisk breeze that may feel biting as it sweeps off Lake Michigan. Light snow is falling, lending a wintry charm but also creating a rather bleak and overcast atmosphere. As the day progresses, expect scattered snow showers to continue into the overnight hours, with skies remaining mostly cloudy and temperatures dipping slightly.\n\nFor Thursday, anticipate a more dynamic weather pattern with snow expected before noon, transitioning into rain mixed with snow. The high temperature will reach the low 40s, but with winds gusting ferociously up to 50 mph, it will feel much cooler, bringing a greater chance of precipitation. Given these conditions, it\u2019s advisable to dress in layers, don a warm coat, and consider waterproof footwear as you'll likely encounter slushy streets or icy patches near the beach. While the waters of Lake Michigan may be too turbulent for swimming, those looking for a brisk walk might find the changing conditions invigorating, particularly as snow gives way to rain, highlighting the unpredictable nature of late fall in this region. As we approach Thanksgiving, the festive spirit may be set against a backdrop of wintry weather, encouraging cozy indoor gatherings in the days to come.",
