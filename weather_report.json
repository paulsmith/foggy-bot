    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a damp and murky atmosphere, with light rain softly falling and a high degree of humidity lingering in the air, creating a distinctly muggy feel. The temperature is in the mid-60s, which is fairly typical for this time of year in the region. As we gaze towards the day ahead, expect persistent rain in the morning, shifting to more scattered showers and even thunderstorms later. The clouds are thick and foreboding, casting a gray pall over the landscape. Gusty winds from the south will make their presence felt, with stronger gusts potentially stirring up waves on Lake Michigan.\n\nDespite these less-than-ideal conditions, those who don suitable rain gear could still find enjoyment outdoors. However, with the prediction of heavy rainfall and possibly severe thunderstorms later, it would be wise to prepare for a cozy day inside or to engage in activities that are sheltered from the elements. A sturdy umbrella and waterproof shoes are strongly recommended for anyone venturing out today. As we mark the beginning of November, the season is clearly advancing toward chillier days, and today\u2019s weather perfectly embodies the transition from autumn\u2019s crispness to the drearier, wetter days of late fall.",
