    "weather_report": "The current weather in Evanston offers a crisp and cool ambiance, with temperatures lingering in the low 30s and a substantial wind creating a brisk feel along the shoreline. The sky hangs heavily with clouds, casting a muted light over the beach, while the gusty breeze from the west intensifies the chill, making it advisable to wrap up warmly if venturing outside. \n\nLooking ahead, expect a cloudy day with temperatures peaking in the upper 30s. As night falls, snow is likely after midnight, with a chance of light accumulation, bringing a wintry touch to the landscape. The waves on Lake Michigan will likely be moderate, reflecting the stirring winds but without significant height, making it less than ideal for water activities. Given the cool temperatures and impending snow, it's best to opt for heavy winter attire with layers and waterproof options if venturing out. While winter in this region typically sees these lower temperatures, the day presents an opportunity for a bundled-up walk along the beach, appreciating the quiet of the season before the snowfall begins.",
