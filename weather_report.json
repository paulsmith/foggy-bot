    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the morning greets us with a chilly embrace, as temperatures hover in the low 40s accompanied by a damp atmosphere, casting an aura of coolness that is further intensified by a fierce southeast wind. The day starts off cloudy and somewhat dreary, with a veil of clouds overhead and a strong breeze sweeping across the beach towards Lake Michigan, stirring up a sense of unrest in the waters, which are likely exhibiting moderate waves.\n\nAs the day progresses, expect a transition into a slightly warmer afternoon, aiming for highs near the mid-50s. However, a chance of rain arrives after 5 PM, increasing dramatically throughout the evening. This forecast indicates a high probability of precipitation, making it essential for residents and visitors alike to prepare for a wet evening, with expected rainfall between half an inch to three-quarters of an inch. Given these conditions, the attire for the day should be layered\u2014consider a warm jacket and perhaps a raincoat or umbrella for later. \n\nIn terms of seasonal context, these temperatures are typical for mid-November in this region, characterized by a stark chill as we inch closer to winter's grasp. Activities might be best enjoyed indoors today, perhaps a warm coffee at a local caf\u00e9 or visiting one of Evanston\u2019s cultural spots. As we navigate through this gray day, a reminder to stay dry and warm will be fitting as we head into the evening.",
