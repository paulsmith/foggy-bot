    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Evanston, the temperature lingers in the lower 20s, creating a chilly atmosphere that resonates with the season. The air is brisk, with a cool clarity that accompanies a comfortably dry experience, hinting at the winter approaching fast. Under mostly clear skies, the wind whispers from the northwest at a spirited pace, lending a sharp edge to the chill, while wind chill values dip as low as -2. Tonight promises a low around 13, making it a perfect night to cozy up indoors.\n\nLooking forward to Sunday, the forecast suggests a predominantly sunny outlook, with temperatures reaching the high 20s. Winds will shift to a gentler pace, but the threat of biting cold remains with wind chill values maintaining their frosty demeanor. Waves along Lake Michigan are likely moderate, reflecting the wind's energy rather than presenting a tumultuous character, which makes this a less than ideal day for outdoor water activities. Given the seasonal conditions, layering up is advisable; a warm coat, hat, and gloves will be essential for bracing against the winter chill. No significant precipitation is expected, allowing for clear, crisp air ideal for a brisk walk along the shore or a steamy coffee break in a local caf\u00e9. Although today isn't marked by any major holidays, the impending festive season is just around the corner, encouraging exploration and a touch of holiday cheer in the air.",
