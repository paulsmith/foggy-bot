    "weather_report": "As twilight settles over Evanston, the evening air is cool and has a slightly breezy quality, with current temperatures in the upper 50s and a mix of soft, lingering clouds in the sky. These conditions create a rather pleasant atmosphere for a late autumn night. The forecast for tonight hints at a slight chance of rain showers before 8 PM, transitioning to partly cloudy skies as temperatures dip toward the mid-40s, accompanied by a gentle breeze from the west-northwest.\n\nThe weather tomorrow promises a shift with persistent rain showers expected to roll in after 10 AM, pushing the daytime high just into the mid-50s. The winds will pick up as well, blowing easterly with gusts potentially reaching 30 miles per hour, just in time for the morning commute. The likelihood of rain is significant, making outdoor plans a bit precarious. Given the season, these temperatures are fairly typical, reflecting the coolness expected for November in this region. With the current atmospheric conditions and impending rain, it\u2019s wise to dress in layers and have an umbrella at the ready, especially for anyone planning to be out early in the day. Until the rain arrives, the beach scene might be a serene spot for a quiet evening walk by Lake Michigan, but anticipate a muddy shoreline come morning.",
