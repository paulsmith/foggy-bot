    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston depict a chilly evening with temperatures hovering in the low 30s, accompanied by a mostly cloudy sky. As forecasted, tonight is set to bring intermittent snow showers and a slight chance of snow around the early morning hours, suggesting a tranquil yet frigid ambiance for those outdoors. The mercury will drop to about 23, rising slightly as the night progresses, while a gentle southwest breeze adds a crispness to the air.\n\nAs we look ahead to Tuesday, a chance of snow continues, with cloudy skies prevailing and highs reaching the upper 20s. Given the time of year, these temperatures are about appropriate for a town alongside the lakes in northern Illinois. For those planning to venture outdoors, dressing warmly with layers, perhaps a sturdy coat, gloves, and a knit hat will ensure comfort against the biting air and potential flurries. However, while the beach may not provide ideal sunbathing conditions, an invigorating walk by the lakeshore could prove refreshing, redeeming this wintery scene.",
