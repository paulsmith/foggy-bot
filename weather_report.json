    "weather_report": "As evening sets in over Evanston, the air carries a palpable sense of humidity, hinting at the storms expected later tonight. The clouds loom heavily, dark and moist under the waning light. With temperatures hovering around 64 degrees, a gentle rise to 66 overnight coupled with gusty southern winds of up to 25 mph creates an unsettling yet invigorating atmosphere. The forecast calls for showers and thunderstorms to roll in around 2 a.m., with precipitation chances at a noteworthy 80%. Those outside may soon find themselves seeking refuge as drops begin to pelt the ground, potentially adding a quarter to half-inch of moisture to the already dampened landscape.\n\nLooking ahead to Thursday, the morning will yield to a blend of showers and possible thunderstorms giving way to a moment of respite just after noon. Despite a high of 66 degrees, a notable drop to around 56 is anticipated by afternoon, making layering a wise choice for those venturing out. The gusts are expected to intensify, peaking at 45 mph, presenting a blustery reminder of the season. The scenery along the lake's edge may appear turbulent, with rough waves churning against the shoreline, suggesting a possibly turbulent day ahead. Evening plans should take into account the likelihood of rain; cozy evenings indoors with warm beverages could be a fitting antidote to the chilly, unsettled weather.",
