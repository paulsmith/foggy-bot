    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather paints a scene of a cold, blustery winter night. The temperature hovers in the low single digits, accompanied by a significant wind that carries a biting chill. It feels markedly colder, with wind chill plunging to nearly -8 degrees, contributing to an environment that demands caution and warmth. Tonight is mostly cloudy with intermittent snow showers and a slight chance of accumulating snow as temperatures dip down to around 7 degrees.\n\nLooking ahead to Thursday, the day will begin with a chance of lingering snow showers, clearing to mostly sunny skies. The temperature will manage to rise to the mid-20s, a modest improvement yet still firmly in winter\u2019s embrace. The winds will remain noticeable, adding a robust edge to the coolness, and the overall appearance of the day is crisp and bright with a hint of snow on the ground. \n\nGiven the prevailing conditions, dressing in layers, including insulated outerwear and accessories such as hats, gloves, and scarves, is essential for comfort. Outdoor enthusiasts should be mindful of possible snow-covered paths, making afternoon strolls scenic yet potentially slippery. While temperatures are typical for mid-February in this region, snowy landscapes provide a picturesque contrast worth appreciating, particularly for those inclined towards winter walks or enjoying the tranquility of a snow-laden beach.",
