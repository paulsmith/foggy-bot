    "weather_report": "As evening falls over Evanston, the temperature lingers in the low 50s, presenting a crisp and cool atmosphere, enhanced by a gentle wind brushing in from the west. With mostly clear skies, visibility is good, though you can expect a change as we move into the early hours; a chance of rain showers is on the horizon, paving the way for a cloudier night. Later temperatures are forecasted to dip, hovering around the low 40s as we approach dawn. The wind is expected to shift to a light breeze, making for a more tranquil feel overnight.\n\nTomorrow, you can anticipate an unsettled day ahead, as rain showers are likely until mid-morning, giving way to scattered showers through the afternoon. The high will struggle to reach the upper 40s before dipping back into the low 40s later in the day, all accompanied by a brisk west wind that could gust up to 30 miles per hour. Given these conditions, be prepared for a damp and breezy day that may not inspire outdoor activities, but if you must venture out, layered clothing is advisable to combat the chill and potential rain. While the current season has brought a typical late autumn chill to the region, keep an eye on your umbrellas tonight; there\u2019s a decent chance of precipitation, so be sure to dress for the elements as we move past this fall evening.",
