    "weather_report": "The evening air in Evanston is brisk and cool, with a current temperature hovering in the mid-30s and a gentle, lingering humidity that adds a bite to the chill. The wind, moving at a noticeable pace, carries a cloud cover that paints the sky in muted tones, creating a somewhat somber ambiance. As night falls, conditions remain stable heading into a night that may bring a light dusting of snow, particularly between one and five in the morning, though no significant accumulation is expected.\n\nLooking ahead to Wednesday, residents can anticipate mostly cloudy skies with temperatures peaking in the upper 40s. A light breeze will accompany the day, making it suitable for a light jacket, but the overall sensation will remain comfortably cool. The lake\u2019s waves can be expected to be modest, reflecting the calmer winds, proving more inviting for brief gazes rather than adventure on the water. As the holiday season approaches, with December just days away, the current weather feels typical for late November, setting the stage for winter activities. Those who venture out may find solace in a warm beverage, perhaps while taking a walk along the shore or enjoying the peacefulness of the beach at night.",
