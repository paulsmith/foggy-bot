    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston paint a chillier picture with temperatures in the mid-40s, accompanied by a damp and overcast feel that lingers in the air. With the humidity elevated, the atmosphere feels distinctly cool and slightly brisk, making the day less inviting for those looking to spend long hours outdoors. As we progress through the day, clouds will continue to dominate the sky, with temperatures reaching close to the low 50s in the afternoon before dipping again. Winds from the south, blowing at a gentle to moderate pace, may produce localized breezes, making it feel a touch cooler on the lakeshore.\n\nWave conditions are likely to be calm given the light winds, although the cloud cover casts a subdued light over Lake Michigan, offering a less vibrant coastline. While tonight brings a slight chance of rain, the likelihood remains low, with only a tentative sprinkle expected after 3 AM. As a result, dressing in layers would be advisable to accommodate the fluctuating temperatures and to stay warm during any potential dampness that may arise. With the current season marking the midst of November in the Midwest, such cool temperatures are typical for this time of year; however, the dreariness may put a damper on outdoor plans. Given the weather, anyone considering a stroll along the beach or engaging in light jogging may enjoy those activities, although taking along a warm drink could enhance the experience.",
