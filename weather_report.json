    "weather_report": "In Evanston this morning, a thick blanket of fog and light drizzle cloaks the shoreline, creating an atmosphere that feels both damp and cool. With temperatures lingering in the low 50s and heavy humidity, it\u2019s a decidedly chilly scene by Lake Michigan, where visibility may be reduced. Today's forecast suggests a continuation of overcast skies with a high nearing the mid-50s, as areas of drizzle persist before giving way to occasional rain showers, particularly in the morning hours. The wind, gently whispering from the west-northwest at around 5 to 15 miles per hour, has the potential to gust up to 25 miles an hour, which might add a brisk edge to those stepping out.\n\nGiven the possibly dreary aesthetics and cool temperatures typical for mid-November here, a warm jacket and rain gear are recommended for those planning to venture outside today. The wave conditions look calm, with minimal surf activity, suitable for leisurely views rather than aquatic adventures. While the atmosphere may not lend itself to lively outdoor activities, it could be a pleasant day for a visit to cozy local caf\u00e9s or bookstores, perfect for indulging in a good novel or enjoying a warm drink. It's worth noting that while today isn't a holiday, Thanksgiving is just around the corner, making it a reflective time for many in the community.",
