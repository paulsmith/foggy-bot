    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently experiencing a rather dreary afternoon with light rain contributing to a damp atmosphere, as the temperature hovers in the mid-50s. The sky is heavily overcast, casting a grayish pall over the beach, while a blustery southeast wind whips through at about 33 miles an hour, creating a brisk chill in the air. Conditions are expected to worsen, with rain showers likely continuing into the evening, and thunderstorms possible later on, as temperatures gradually rise to the low 60s. The chance of precipitation stands at a near certainty, accompanied by significant rainfall accumulation anticipated between half an inch to three-quarters of an inch.\n\nThe lake's surface shows some movement, with moderate waves reflecting the increased winds and impending storm conditions, presenting a less than pleasant sight for those hoping to enjoy the outdoors. Given the wet and windy forecast, it's advisable to wear a waterproof jacket, sturdy shoes, and perhaps carry an umbrella if venturing outside. For this time of year in late autumn, the temperature feels slightly cooler than typical for the region, hinting at the approach of winter. With inclement weather prevailing, indoor activities such as visiting local cafes or art galleries will be far more enjoyable than attempting to brave the beach, despite its often serene beauty\u2014where today, the allure of Lake Michigan is masked by clouds and rain.",
