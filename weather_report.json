    "weather_report": "As evening descends on Evanston, the air carries a cool and damp chill typical of late November. Currently, temperatures linger in the upper 40s with a gentle breeze coming from the southeast, creating an atmosphere that feels more brisk than inviting. The sky is shrouded in clouds, casting a muted, gray ambiance over the shoreline as the Lake Michigan waves lap softly at the sand.\n\nLooking ahead, patchy drizzle is expected later this evening, giving way to scattered rain showers overnight, with a low hovering around 47 degrees. Tomorrow promises a similarly cloudy scenario, punctuated by morning drizzle and a slight drop in temperatures, peaking near 51 before taking a turn downward in the afternoon. Wind gusts may whip at times, particularly in the southwest, enhancing the already brisk conditions. With a 40% chance of precipitation tonight and a 30% chance tomorrow, those planning activities along the beach should prepare for possible interruptions.\n\nGiven these conditions, it\u2019s advisable to dress in layers, favoring a warm jacket and perhaps a water-resistant outer layer for those venturing outdoors. The temperature, while typical for the season, may feel uncomfortably cool coupled with the impending rain. Outdoor activities may be limited to brief excursions, perhaps a quick stroll along the beach or a visit to a local caf\u00e9 to enjoy a warm drink while watching the clouds roll over the lake. \n\nAs this is not a holiday weekend, but with the holiday season approaching, there\u2019s a sense of anticipation in the air. Evanston's shoreline may reflect a more subdued beauty, perhaps ideal for quiet contemplation as nature begins its winter slumber.",
