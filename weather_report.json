    "weather_report": "As night settles over Evanston, a brisk, cloudy evening greets residents with temperatures in the mid to upper 30s, accompanied by a chilling north wind creating a blustery atmosphere. The forecast hints at light rain showers before dawn, yet the skies remain predominantly overcast tonight. As temperatures dip only slightly to around freezing, any potential precipitation is expected to be minimal, lingering around a fraction of an inch.\n\nLooking ahead to Thanksgiving Day, a shift in weather is anticipated, bringing clearer skies and mostly sunny conditions. Highs will hover in the mid 30s, gradually cooling to around 33 by late afternoon, with a continued northwesterly breeze keeping the air feeling crisp. With these conditions, the beachfront is likely to exhibit some wave activity, but without any significant risks. Given the season, these temperatures fall within the realm of typical late November weather in this region. Residents are advised to bundle up with warm layers\u2014perhaps a heavy jacket, scarf, and gloves\u2014to combat the chill, especially if venturing outdoors in the morning. Ideal activities may include a brisk walk along the shoreline to appreciate the raw beauty of winter by the lake, or cozy gatherings indoors, celebrating Thanksgiving alongside loved ones.",
