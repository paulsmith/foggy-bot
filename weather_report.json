    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current outdoor conditions are marked by a chilly feel with temperatures in the low 40s and a gentle mist of light drizzle adding a damp chill to the air. The sky is overcast, creating a rather gray and uninviting atmosphere that might deter leisurely strolls along the beach. As night approaches, temperatures are expected to dip further, bringing patchy fog and a potential for light rain overnight, with environments getting slightly warmer as the morning rises into the mid-40s. \n\nThe wave conditions in Lake Michigan are relatively calm, although in the presence of a gentle breeze that may pick up slightly overnight. The likelihood of rain tomorrow morning also suggests you should check the weather before planning any outdoor activities. Given the dampness and chill, wearing layers and a waterproof jacket is advisable, along with comfortable footwear if venturing outside. This time of year, the temperatures are fairly typical for December in Northern Illinois, adding to the seasonal charm, albeit with a damp, less than pleasant twist. For those looking to stay active, finding indoor activities like visiting local caf\u00e9s or cultural spots might be the best approach, especially on this otherwise dreary evening in December.",
