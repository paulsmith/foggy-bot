    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the evening temperatures hover in the low 50s, creating a pleasantly cool atmosphere, though the gentle chill is enhanced by a notable breeze from the south. The skies remain clear at the moment, offering an unobstructed view of the night stars, but there is a shift expected as areas of drizzle are forecasted to develop after 8 PM. With the temperature anticipated to dip to around the mid 40s overnight, this slight downturn will make for a brisk outing if you find yourself outside. \n\nFor the day ahead, anticipate partly sunny skies, with temperatures peaking at around the low 50s before falling slightly in the afternoon. Winds will remain notably breezy, allowing for that fresh, invigorating feeling typical of this time of year along the shores of Lake Michigan. As the season settles into winter, the current temperatures are fairly representative of December's character, though they may feel a bit chillier when factoring in the wind. For those planning to venture outdoors, a warm jacket and perhaps a hat would offer comfort against the cool air and potential drizzle later on. A stroll along the beach could still be enjoyable, especially to appreciate the onset of winter's embrace before the rain sets in.",
