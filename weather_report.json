    "weather_report": "As the clock approaches the early hours, Evanston is waking to a stark and blustery scene, where temperatures hover in the mid-30s, accompanied by a cool overcast sky. The atmosphere is thick with a damp chill, creating a sense of briskness in the air, while howling winds sweep in from the north-northwest at a vigorous pace. This weather paints a picture typical of late November in the Midwest, as winter begins to stake its claim over Lake Michigan.\n\nLooking ahead, the forecast predicts a day filled with mostly cloudy skies, with temperatures reaching a high near 36 before steadily dropping to around 32 by afternoon. Despite the significant winds expected to calm slightly, the gusts may still pack a punch, hinting at a fierce wind chill that will accentuate the day's chill. There's no significant threat of precipitation right now, but the air feels moody and heavy, likely driving locals to seek warmth indoors. For those brave enough to venture out, warm layers are essential\u2014think heavy coats, hats, and gloves to guard against the penetrating cold. While the beach may not be buzzing with activity today, an afternoon stroll along the shore could still be invigorating, provided one is mindful of the stark beauty and raw intensity of the lake during this season.",
