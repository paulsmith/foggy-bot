    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston feature a cool and damp atmosphere with temperatures in the low 40s, where a thick blanket of fog wraps the area, lending a soft, muted quality to the surroundings. With a blustery south wind stirring at nearly 21 mph, coolness is palpable, while visibility may be limited due to fog and mist. Tonight, expect patchy fog to persist into the early hours, accompanied by a slight chance of rain, particularly as the evening unfolds. Overnight lows will hover near 42, nudging up to around 44, with gentle breezes continuing.\n\nAs we look to Monday, the dreary weather pattern lingers with remnants of fog and chances for light rain early in the day. The temperatures will climb to the low 50s, but may drop back to the mid-40s by afternoon, creating a considerably chilly scene. Given the season \u2014 mid-December in northern Illinois \u2014 these temperatures are typical, though the dampness adds an edge of discomfort. With wave conditions on Lake Michigan likely to be choppy as winds increase, it's wise to dress warmly in layers and perhaps toward waterproof attire if venturing out. Outdoor activities may be limited, making this a perfect day for indoor pursuits, cozying up with a good book, or visiting local cafes while staying dry in this fog-wreathed, wintery setting.",
