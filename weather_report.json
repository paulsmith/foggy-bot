    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston offer a taste of winter's chill, with temperatures lingering in the mid 30s, accompanied by a damp crispness that underscores the early night. A swift, howling wind from the west contributes to an overall sense of a blustery evening, particularly as light snow falls gently, painting the landscape in a layer of wintery white. The beach scene, viewed from the parks department, feels more tranquil than inviting, with the Lake Michigan waters likely churning as the wind creates a mesmerizing dance of waves against the shore.\n\nAs we transition into the evening, expect scattered snow showers to continue until about 7 PM, giving way to a mix of rain and snow. Tomorrow\u2019s forecast promises a full embrace of winter, with heavy snow likely before noon, transitioning into rain and snow throughout the day. The high will reach into the low 40s, though temperatures will dip in the afternoon alongside gusty winds that could reach up to 45 mph. For those venturing outdoors, warm layers are essential in this chilly climate, ideally with waterproof outerwear to stay dry amidst the precipitation. Given the fleeting nature of pleasant outdoor activities, a cozy evening indoors with a warm drink might be the best option, while those keen on winter\u2019s splendor may indulge in the snow for a bit of evening fun. As we stand at the threshold of this pre-Thanksgiving week, the seasonal chill feels typical, setting the stage for the upcoming holiday festivities.",
