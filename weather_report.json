    "weather_report": "Tonight in Evanston, the air carries a chill as the temperature drifts into the low 50s, wrapped in a blanket of moisture that lends a damp, misty quality to the atmosphere. As the clock nears 3 a.m., expect patchy fog to cloak the beaches and streets. The gentle, whispering winds will barely rustle the trees, and the sporadic chance of light rain may add a sprinkle to this gray, mostly cloudy backdrop. \n\nLooking ahead to Monday, dawn may arrive with fog lingering until about 7 a.m., but as the day progresses, the clouds will thicken, and rain showers are likely to grace the area, contributing to a risk of scattered rainfall throughout the day. The high will inch towards the mid-50s, accompanied by a brisk east wind adding to the chill. The conditions may feel slightly damp and dreary, reflecting that late autumn vibe typical for this time of year in the Midwest. Therefore, a cozy jacket and perhaps a waterproof layer are prudent choices for those venturing outside. Given the potential drizzle and cooler temperatures, it may be best to keep indoor activities in mind, such as visiting local cafes or cozying up with a good book, especially as we approach the holiday season.",
