    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently experiencing brisk conditions, with temperatures in the mid 30s accompanied by a noticeable breeze that has a fierce nature, creating a shivering chill as one steps outside. The sky is predominantly overcast, rendering the daylight a muted gray, but there's no immediate threat of precipitation. The rest of the day is expected to see a gradual warming to a high in the low 40s, with winds calming slightly yet still likely to present a noticeable gustiness.\n\nAs evening approaches, the skies will shift to a partly cloudy embrace, housing a low temperature around the mid 30s. Residents can expect mild wave activity from Lake Michigan, though it should remain manageable. For those venturing outdoors, layered attire is advisable \u2014 a warm coat, gloves, and a scarf would keep the chill at bay, especially in this season, as temperatures are typically colder in December. While it may not be the most inviting day for outdoor recreation, a brisk walk along the beach or an impromptu visit to a local caf\u00e9 could be refreshing. \n\nWith no significant holidays on the horizon today, it\u2019s a perfect time for those looking to enjoy winter's early presence.",
