    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current scene is marked by cool temperatures hovering in the mid 30s, accompanied by a blanket of dense fog and light drizzle that shrouds the familiar landscape. The air feels brisk and a bit damp, with a gentle breeze whispering off Lake Michigan, contributing to an overall murky and unsettled ambiance that may leave residents yearning for clearer skies. As we look ahead, the forecast indicates that the drizzle and fog will persist throughout the day, with cloudy skies and a high approaching the low 40s, making it a day best spent indoors. \n\nWith wave conditions likely to be calm at the beach due to the minimal wind, it may not be an ideal moment for boating or outdoor activities. Light raingear is recommended for anyone braving the elements, along with warm layers to fend off the chill as temperatures slowly rise throughout the night. While the day itself does not fall on a notable holiday, the cozy atmosphere may inspire some to enjoy the soft glow of holiday lights as winter unfolds. Given the season, these temperatures align with what one might expect in mid-December, set against a backdrop of winter routines and preparations for the festivities ahead.",
