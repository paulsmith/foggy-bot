    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather presents a cool, somewhat dreary picture, with temperatures in the low 40s and a strong blanket of fog hanging in the air. The gentle breeze from the south, coupled with the dampness, makes it feel quite crisp. As the day progresses, expect more of the same, with clouds enveloping the skies and the potential for rain showers developing later this evening. Currently, the conditions are less than ideal for outdoor activities, with wave action on the lake appearing mild, though the fog may obscure visibility.\n\nTonight, as the temperature dips to around 40, with a slow rise after midnight, it's advisable to wear a light jacket or layered clothing to stay comfortable. Given the damp atmosphere and upcoming chance of rain, it may be best to plan indoor activities or an early evening stroll along the beach to enjoy the moody ambiance. Today is not marked by any significant holidays, setting a tranquil pace before the festivities of the upcoming weeks.",
