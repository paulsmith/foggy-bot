    "weather_report": "This morning in Evanston, conditions are decidedly dreary, with temperatures lingering in the low 50s and high humidity making the air feel heavier. The atmosphere is thick with clouds, hinting at the potential for light drizzle and patchy fog, particularly before noon. A gentle breeze from the northwest stirs the air, adding a slight chill that could leave one feeling a bit uncomfortable without a proper layer. The beach view is likely obscured by the overcast sky, casting a grey pallor over the tranquil waters of Lake Michigan.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect a continuation of cloudy skies with a high nearing the mid-50s, before temperatures gradually settle back into the low 50s by afternoon. The chance of precipitation is around 40%, so keep an umbrella handy, especially if venturing out for any midday activities. For anyone considering outdoor plans, the weather leans towards the chilly and damp, making it a great day to cozy up indoors. Wave conditions at the beach may not be ideal for swimming but could be suitable for a peaceful walk along the shoreline, provided one is adequately dressed. As autumn settles in, this weather is typical for mid-November in the Midwest, with cool temperatures and unpredictable skies. Today is a regular Tuesday with no major holiday looming, but the next few days may offer clearer conditions for those hoping to soak up the dwindling fall sunshine.",
