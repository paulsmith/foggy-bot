    "weather_report": "As evening descends upon Evanston, current conditions reflect a chilly, damp atmosphere with light rain and persistent fog adding to the overall gloom. Temperatures rest in the mid-30s, and a brisk, blustery wind from the southeast enhances the raw feel outdoors. These damp elements combine to create a rather uncomfortable environment, with visibility likely reduced due to the fog.\n\nLooking ahead, the forecast promises continued wetness tonight with rain expected before midnight, followed by drizzle and patchy fog into the early hours. Overnight lows will hover in the upper 30s, gradually rising to around 40 as the night wears on. A gentle, yet gusty, southeast wind will accompany these conditions, making it advisable to stay indoors if possible. Tomorrow is set to bring a similar vibe with cloud cover and areas of drizzle lingering through the day, peaking at a high near the low 40s. \n\nGiven the weather and the evening's chill, it would be wise to bundle up in warm layers, perhaps a thick coat and waterproof jacket, alongside sturdy footwear if venturing outside. Wave conditions on Lake Michigan will likely be choppy given the wind speed, which could be enticing for a few brave souls keen on braving the elements, but for most, curling up indoors with a warm drink sounds far more appealing. As we approach the winter season, these temperatures are typical for mid-December, underscoring the need for cozy indoor activities as the holidays approach.",
