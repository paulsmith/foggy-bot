    "weather_report": "As the clock ticks towards the early hours of December 20th, Evanston is gripped by a chilly embrace, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s. The air is thick and damp, making it feel especially cool as light snow flurries dance in the light breeze. Visibility is diminished with fog and mist, casting a muted veil over the landscape, offering a somber yet serene beauty to the view of the beach and Lake Michigan.\n\nLooking ahead, the forecast suggests a continuation of this snowy scene as overnight snowfall accumulates slightly, with conditions expected to shift throughout the day. The morning will bring a likelihood of snow showers combined with a whisper of drizzle, with temperatures reaching a peak in the mid 30s before trailing off into the afternoon chill. A brisk north wind could whip up waves along the lake, adding to the dynamic feel of the day. With the precipitation likely continuing at a high rate, it's advisable for residents to dress warmly in layers, donning a waterproof outer layer to keep the elements at bay. The holiday season is upon us, and as festive activities await, one might prefer indoors\u2014perhaps embracing the warmth of community spaces or cozying up with loved ones, reflecting on the impending joys of the season.",
