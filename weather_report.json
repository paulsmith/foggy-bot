    "weather_report": "As evening settles in Evanston, the temperature rests in the low 60s, creating a pleasantly cool atmosphere underscored by a gentle, yet brisk breeze. Currently, the sky boasts a mostly clear expanse, although a shift is on the horizon, hinting at the possibility of rain developing overnight. With a forecasted drop into the low 40s by morning, temperatures will rise slightly to around 44 degrees, making this evening feel notably crisp as the wind shifts to a calmer pace. This transitional weather brings both a delightful chill and a sense of unease as clouds begin to gather.\n\nFor those planning to venture outside, layering is advisable\u2014consider a warm jacket and perhaps a light hat to combat the coolness. The opportunity for a brisk walk along the beach could be invigorating, but expectations for a sunny day tomorrow may have to be tempered with the likelihood of rain showers and a high peaking around the upper 40s. This time of year typically welcomes such fluctuations, and today's warmth juxtaposes sharply with the cooler nights of late November\u2014a reminder that winter is just around the corner. Grab a warm drink and enjoy the crisp evening air, but keep an umbrella handy for any potential downpours in the night ahead.",
