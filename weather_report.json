    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston paint a chilly picture, with temperatures hovering in the mid 20s, under mostly cloudy skies. A fierce breeze gusts from the east, creating a crisp atmosphere that might make a stroll along the beach feel brisk. As we look ahead, today\u2019s forecast suggests a significant shift, as a slight chance of sleet and rain develops later in the afternoon. The clouds will thicken and temperatures are expected to reach the upper 30s, accompanied by a steady breeze and gusty conditions. This evening, rain is almost certain, likely transforming into patchy drizzle and fog, with temperatures holding steady around 40 degrees.\n\nWith the anticipated rain, it\u2019s advisable to bundle up with a warm coat, perhaps a sturdy umbrella for later, and suitable footwear for potentially muddy paths. The overall vibe outside is decidedly wintry, typical for mid-December in this part of Illinois, with current chill consistent with the season's character. For those contemplating outdoor activities, the morning may offer a brisk walk along the beach, though as the day unfolds, cozy indoor pursuits could be more inviting.",
