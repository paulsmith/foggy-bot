    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly afternoon with an overcast sky, where temperatures hover in the upper 30s, complemented by a brisk and blustery wind whipping at nearly 25 mph from the west-southwest. As the day progresses, expect temperatures to dip slightly, falling into the low 40s, with a sense of dampness in the air likely contributing to a rather cool and possibly uncomfortable feel if exposed for too long. \n\nRest assured, this evening brings a shift toward patchy fog and drizzle, particularly after 11 PM, as temperatures settle around the mid-30s. Winds will soften to a gentle whisper, but the lake's waves remain a bit restless, hinting at an unsettled water surface. Given the current season, these temperatures are quite typical for late November in the Midwest, though they may feel a bit biting due to the conditions. For outdoor ventures, warmly layered attire is recommended, ideally featuring a windproof jacket and comfortable footwear, since lingering drizzles could make for slippery paths. With the holiday season around the corner, this chilly weather might just be the backdrop for cozy indoor gatherings rather than outdoor adventures.",
