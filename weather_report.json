    "weather_report": "Current weather conditions in Evanston are quite crisp, with temperatures in the low 20s and a substantial wind that adds a biting chill to the air. It's mostly cloudy, enhancing the wintery feel as wind gusts whip through at a fierce pace, creating a wintry scene that might discourage long outdoor excursions. As evening approaches, expect a chance of snow flurries before 7 PM, transitioning to partly cloudy skies with temperatures dipping to around 4 degrees, while wind chills could plunge as low as -13. \n\nFor the upcoming weather, Washington's Birthday promises to be partly sunny, though daytime temperatures will only rise to the low teens, accompanied by similar wind chill values. Perfect for bundled sweaters and thick coats, those venturing outside should prepare for cold and breezy conditions. The lake may feature moderate waves, typical for this time of year, which could be enticing for a brisk stroll along the beach, although caution is advised given the strong winds. Overall, this is a classic winter day in the Midwest, with temperatures reflecting the season and region. Ideal activities might include cozying up with a warm drink or preparing for the upcoming holiday celebrations as Presidents\u2019 Day draws near.",
