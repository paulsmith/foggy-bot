    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Evanston, the current conditions reveal a chilly scene, with temperatures hovering in the low teens. The air is crisp and dry, complemented by a clear sky that promises bright sunshine later in the day. However, despite the clarity, the wind adds a biting edge, particularly with wind chill values plummeting as low as -4. Waves on Lake Michigan are likely to be stirred up, creating a restless surf in conjunction with the expected gusty winds reaching up to 20 mph.\n\nLooking ahead, occasional snow showers are anticipated early in the day, giving way to mostly sunny conditions by afternoon. The high temperature will glide up to the upper 20s, with a gradual decline towards the 16-degree mark tonight. Outdoor plans may require some adjustments; bundled layers will be essential for warmth, especially with the windy conditions that will make outdoor excursions feel even colder. Given the current season, these temperatures are typical for early December in this region, lending a wintry charm to the landscape. Suggestions for activities might include a brisk walk along the shore or enjoying the local cafes, as long as visitors are prepared for the chill.",
