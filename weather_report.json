    "weather_report": "As evening descends upon Evanston, the air carries a brisk chill, typical for early November in this lakeside community. With current temperatures nestled in the low 50s and a slightly damp ambiance, the atmosphere feels refreshingly cool. Winds from the east are noticeably gusty, adding a lively touch to the atmosphere while wisping through the trees. The skies are mostly cloudy, providing a muted yet serene canvas as daylight fades into night.\n\nLooking ahead, the forecast hints at a change in the weather, with rain showers likely to move in tomorrow afternoon. The anticipated rise into the low 60s, paired with a southeast breeze that could reach 20 mph, suggests that outdoor excursions may be best suited for earlier in the day. As waves rise just beyond the beach, they promise a robust spectacle for those who appreciate the powerful beauty of Lake Michigan, yet surf conditions may deter casual swimmers. For tonight, a light jacket should suffice for those venturing outdoors, as the coolness in the air lingers, making for pleasant evening strolls or a quiet moment by the shore, as the lake softly laps at the sand.",
