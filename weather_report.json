    "weather_report": "As residents of Evanston step into the day, they face a crisp and chilly atmosphere, with current temperatures resting in the low 20s. The scene is mostly cloudy, but there are hints of sunshine to break through. Winds are blustery, stirring the air at about 33 miles per hour, and the waves on Lake Michigan can be expected to ripple fiercely with such gusts. With no precipitation in sight and the air feeling brisk, it\u2019s certainly a day to dress warmly, perhaps in layers, with a sturdy coat, gloves, and a hat to fend off the chill.\n\nLooking ahead, the forecast promises a transition into a partly sunny day, where high temperatures are anticipated to reach around the upper 30s later on, before dipping down into the teens tonight. These winter conditions are typical for this time of year in the Midwest, as January ushers in its frosty embrace. While outdoor activities might be limited due to the cold, the beauty of the lake and the bite of winter can be appreciated with a brisk walk along the shore, perhaps even ending the day with a warm drink in hand as the sun sets on a mostly clear sky.",
