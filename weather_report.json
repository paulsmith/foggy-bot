    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather is a tapestry of late autumn, with gentle temperatures hovering in the low 60s, driven by a damp humidity that wraps around the area. As the night deepens, the atmosphere remains mostly cloudy, with a strong, gusty breeze whispering in from the west, stirring the environment as it brushes over the beach, which is now mostly silent under the moonlight. The forecast for the coming hours indicates a gradual drop in temperature, settling into the low 50s by morning, with a softening wind expected to follow.\n\nLooking ahead to Wednesday, the clouds might part slightly, offering glimpses of sunshine throughout the day, with temperatures struggling to reach the mid-50s. The outlook suggests mild wave conditions on the lake, although the offshore winds may create some chop. As precipitation is notably absent in the immediate forecast, outdoor activities are encouraged, albeit dressed warmly and comfortably. With the fall season painting the surroundings in rich hues and textures, a stroll along the lakeshore, a visit to local parks, or a simple gathering in cozy quarters at home could be ideal pursuits on this tranquil November evening.",
