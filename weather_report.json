    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston are marked by a chill in the air and dampness, with temperatures lingering in the upper 40s. The atmosphere feels quite saturated, creating a refreshingly crisp experience, albeit one that may compel residents to layer up. The blustery winds from the northwest add a distinct edge to the night, making it feel cooler than it might otherwise. As we transition into Friday, expect sustained clouds to dominate the sky, with a high reaching into the low 50s and a light breeze. An overnight patch of drizzle is expected before dawn, further adding to the dullness of the clouds that will persist throughout the day.\n\nWith the nighttime calmness of the lake currently witnessed, wave conditions should remain relatively gentle. Given the overcast and slightly wet environment, outdoor plans might be best kept to brief excursions. Attire for the day should focus on warmth; think jackets and perhaps a light hat to counter the gusts. The temperature this time of year is typical for mid-November in the Midwest, reflecting the onset of winter's chill. As such, indoor activities or nostalgic moments by the waterfront with a warm drink might be the most enjoyable way to embrace the atmosphere as the holiday season approaches.",
