    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the current conditions paint a chilly picture with temperatures hovering in the low 30s, accompanied by brisk winds that create a biting chill, making it feel quite frigid outdoors. The sky is cloaked in a gray blanket of clouds, hinting at an impending wintery mix. As for the forecast, there is a notable chance of snow this afternoon, with temperatures expected to peak near the mid 30s before slipping back down to the low 30s later. Winds will remain gentle yet noticeable, swirling from the southeast with occasional gusts. As night falls, anticipate snow transitioning into rain, with a significant chance of precipitation, including light accumulation of snow.\n\nWith the winter season firmly in place along Lake Michigan, such conditions are to be expected. Today's overcast sky and gusty winds create a dreary vista, reflective of the season's typical character. The waves on the lake are likely stirred up, presenting an unfriendly surface\u2014perhaps more suitable for a cozy afternoon indoors rather than any outdoor excursions. For those braving the elements, warm layers topped with a waterproof outer shell would be advisable to stay comfortable amid the damp chill. Given that it\u2019s mid-December, many may find themselves dreaming of holiday festivities, as the spirit of the season begins to fluff its feathers in the coming days.",
