    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the morning begins with a biting chill, as the temperature hovers in the mid 20s, accompanied by a bracing wind that adds to the crispness of the day, making it feel even colder. The sky above remains dominated by thick, gray clouds, casting a gloomy yet serene pallor over the beach vista toward Lake Michigan. Scattered snow showers are expected to roll in after eight this morning, with a high later near 30 degrees before temperatures retreat to about 24 in the afternoon. Winds from the west-northwest will be brisk, creating robust gusts that could reach 40 miles per hour. \n\nThe weather is decidedly wintry and somewhat unpleasant, particularly for those unprepared for the fierce wind chill values that could plunge to a frosty -14 tonight. Lake conditions may also become choppy as the day progresses, though snow accumulation is predicted to be minimal. Given these conditions, dressing in layers with a warm coat, hat, gloves, and sturdy boots is advisable. The chill in the air serves as a reminder of the season\u2019s grip, making it clear that December is firmly upon us, a time when such temperatures are decidedly typical for the region. While outdoor activities may be limited by the cold, those who brave the elements might enjoy winter walks along the lakeshore or engaging in winter sports, but it\u2019s wise to heed the wind and snow for safety.",
