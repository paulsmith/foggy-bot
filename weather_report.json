    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the weather this morning carries a brisk chill, with temperatures settling in the low 40s, complemented by a hefty dose of humidity that lends a dampness to the air. The winds are fierce, howling from the southwest, creating a feeling of rawness as clouds blanket the sky, setting the stage for a day of unsettled weather. As we move into the afternoon, expect scattered rain showers beginning around 3 PM, with temperatures limping to highs near 48 before retreating to the 40s. Tonight, this pattern shifts, with the potential for scattered snow showers as the clouds deepen, and thermometers dip to around 31. \n\nConsidering the conditions, the beach may appear with a stark yet captivating demeanor, marked by turbulent waters that reflect the blustery atmosphere. While the weather may not be the most inviting for outdoor leisure, bundled layers are advisable if venturing out, especially with gusty winds threatening to chill through even the warmest of coats. As this day unfolds, grab your umbrella if you plan to be outside in the later hours. Although today is not a major holiday, it is a reminder of the seasonal shift here in the Midwest, where temperatures are generally typical for late November, underscoring the beauty of change as we head into winter.",
