    "weather_report": "Current weather conditions in Evanston present a raw chill as temperatures hover in the upper 20s, coupled with light freezing drizzle and persistent fog. The air feels damp and biting, lending an uncomfortable edge, particularly with a spirited breeze sweeping in from the southeast. As we move into the overnight hours, expect continued freezing drizzle along with patchy fog, contributing to a blanket of dreary overcast. The temperature is projected to rise slightly, peaking around 30 degrees accompanied by an 80% chance of precipitation, though little ice accumulation is anticipated.\n\nAs we progress into Thursday, the weather is expected to clear a bit after the morning fog dissipates, giving way to a partly sunny sky. However, the temperature will fall back to around the mid to high 30s in the afternoon, with gusty winds reaching up to 20 miles per hour. Although conditions may improve slightly with breaks in the clouds, the overall atmosphere remains chilly and damp throughout the day. The waves on Lake Michigan could be moderately choppy due to the wind, suggesting that while it may not be ideal for water activities, bundled-up walks along the shore could be invigorating. With winter firmly established in the region, the current temperature aligns with seasonal norms, making it a quintessential backdrop for the season. For those venturing outside, layered attire with a warm coat, hat, and gloves is advisable to combat the biting chill of the air and the wet conditions.",
