    "weather_report": "In Evanston, this morning unfolds under a canopy of partly sunny skies, where a warm breeze dances down from the south southwest at about 25 miles per hour, gusting refreshingly strong, reaching up to 45 miles per hour. The temperature hovers near 79 degrees, presenting a lovely invitation outdoors for those inclined to explore the coastal paths along Lake Michigan, though the wind promises to keep the air feeling brisk. \n\nAs the day transitions to night, expect a shift; a chance of rain showers will weave into the fabric of a mostly cloudy evening, with temperatures gradually rising back to around 68 degrees after dropping to a low of 66. The wind will continue, unyielding, and the chance of precipitation stands at about 80%, hinting at potential showers and thunderstorms particularly between 2 AM and 4 AM. The beach scene, while currently inviting, may forewarn of wetness to come; those considering outdoor plans might don a light jacket for warmth while preparing for the chance of rain. With the waves reflecting a somewhat restless nature and the looming clouds, activities like a leisurely stroll or a brief visit to the beach may be best enjoyed now before the weather turns more unwelcome.",
