    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois, paint a scene characteristic of a chilly December night, currently hovering in the mid-30s, where a brisk breeze stirs the air. The shore lies mostly calm, the cloud cover veiling any clear view of the stars, suggesting a shift towards precipitation as rain and snow are poised to arrive overnight. Expect a low around freezing, with winds softly whispering from the northwest. The morning will likely greet residents with a chance of snow, although the forecast suggests only a dusting, while the afternoon promises a slight break in the clouds before temperatures drop further.\n\nAs the forecast unfolds, conditions are anything but inviting for outdoor activities. The beach may appear deserted as the waves roll silently; the lakefront reflecting the somber ambiance of a winter evening. For those venturing outside, layering is key\u2014a warm coat, hat, and gloves will help fend off the chill that evening brings. As we are deep into the winter season, these temperatures are quite typical for this time of year in the Midwest. With the hustle of the holiday season just days away, it may be best to stay cozy indoors or engage in light holiday preparations instead of braving the cold.",
