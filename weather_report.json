    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current chill gives the air a crisp and cool feeling, with temperatures lingering in the mid-20s and a gusty northwest wind that adds a bite to the day. The clouds overhead paint a rather gray canvas, with mostly cloudy skies prevailing, hinting at potential snow showers this afternoon. The temperature will creep closer to the high 20s but is likely to drop a bit as the day progresses. Tonight promises clearer skies with temperatures settling into the low 20s, maintaining that brisk atmosphere.\n\nThe beach appears quiet, offering gentle but noticeable wave action, perfect for a reflective stroll rather than swimming. While no precipitation is currently affecting the area, the forecast suggests a chance of snow later, making it a wise choice to dress warmly in layers. A warm coat, hat, and gloves will be essential on this winter afternoon. As we embrace early December, these conditions are typical for the season in this part of the Midwest, beckoning one to sip hot cocoa while admiring the lakefront. With a potential holiday spirit in the air as the season unfolds, enjoy an afternoon walk along the shoreline or curl up with a good book indoors.",
