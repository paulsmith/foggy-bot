    "weather_report": "The current weather in Evanston is decidedly brisk, with temperatures hovering in the low 20s and a sharp wind from the west that gives everything a decidedly wintry feel. It's mostly clear tonight, but the chill bites, with wind chill values plunging down to near zero. As we look ahead to Sunday, expect more of the same crisp conditions, with bright sunshine punctuating the cold, and a high that barely rises into the upper 20s. This time of year is typical for the Midwest, as the season embraces the stark beauty of winter.\n\nWith wave activity likely influenced by the strong winds, anyone near the lake should prepare for a rather choppy surface, making for less than ideal conditions for boating or fishing. There's no precipitation in sight, lending to a clear but chilly atmosphere, perfect for bundled outdoor walks. For those venturing outside, layering up is a must; think warm coats, hats, and gloves to ward off the biting cold. As we move into the weekend, these conditions provide a perfect excuse for cozy indoor activities or brief excursions outside to enjoy the fresh winter air.",
