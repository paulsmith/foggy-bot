    "weather_report": "In Evanston, current conditions paint a picture of a cool, cloudy afternoon with temperatures hovering in the upper 50s, suggesting a distinctly damp chill in the air. The atmosphere is quite humid, contributing to a muggy sensation that might make outdoor activities feel less inviting. A fierce wind is whipping in from the southeast, stirring the waters of Lake Michigan and adding to the already cloudy backdrop. As we look ahead, rain showers are expected to intensify, with a 70% chance of precipitation predicted for this afternoon, reaching absolute certainty as we transition into the evening, bringing the risk of thunderstorms along with rising temperatures.\n\nAs we anticipate the evening hours, the weather will remain uninviting for outdoor adventures, with potential rainfall accumulating between half an inch to three-quarters of an inch. For those brave enough to venture outside, a light rain jacket or an umbrella is highly recommended to fend off the wet chill. With late autumn in full swing, these temperatures are typical for the season in this part of the Midwest, as residents are no strangers to gray skies and gusty winds. For the time being, leisurely indoor activities\u2014be it a cozy caf\u00e9 visit or a museum outing\u2014seem the most appealing in light of today's dreary forecast.",
