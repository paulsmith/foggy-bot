    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston are quite brisk, with temperatures hovering in the mid 20s. The air is heavy, giving that typical winter chill an even sharper bite, especially with strong gusts from the north, creating a fiercely blustery atmosphere. Light snow has been falling, adding a delicate touch to the winter landscape as it mingles with the potential for freezing drizzle later today. As we look towards the afternoon, expect **cloudy skies** and a high temperature nearing the low 30s, though it will likely feel much colder due to the wind. Snow showers are expected to continue with an 80 percent chance of precipitation, leading to a light accumulation.\n\nThe overall appearance is one of a stark, wintry scene along the beach, with gently rolling waves lapping at the shore, creating a chilly, somewhat uninviting view for outdoor activities. For those brave enough to venture outside, warm layered clothing is essential, as you'll need to combat the penetrating cold. While today may not be ideal for outdoor fun, cozy indoor pursuits\u2014perhaps reading by the fire or enjoying a warm beverage\u2014could provide a delightful contrast to the wintry conditions. This chilly January day lacks any significant holidays or events, making it a quiet reminder of the season\u2019s grip on our city.",
