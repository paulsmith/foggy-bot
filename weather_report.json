    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Evanston, conditions remain brisk with a temperature hovering in the mid-20s, accompanied by a gentle chill in the air from an eastward breeze. The clouds are predominately overcast, creating a subdued atmosphere, though hints of sunlight peek through occasionally, adding a touch of brightness to the predominantly gray landscape. Wave activity on Lake Michigan is moderate, with gentle lapping at the shore, reflecting the restless nature of the water stirred up by the wind.\n\nAs we look ahead, tonight will see the mercury dip slightly, settling around the mid-20s before rising again overnight. The persistent cloud cover suggests a continuation of the same celestial drama, absent of any significant precipitation. For those venturing outdoors, a layered approach to attire is advisable\u2014a warm jacket complemented by a hat and scarf will ensure comfort against the fresh evening air. Given that we're in December here in the Midwest, these chilly temperatures are typical for this time of year. With holiday gatherings approaching, it\u2019s a splendid time to enjoy local festivities or a brisk walk along the lakeshore, embracing the season\u2019s spirit amidst the winter landscape.",
