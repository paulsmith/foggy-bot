    "weather_report": "Evanston, Illinois, is submerged in a thick shroud of mist this morning, with the temperature hovering in the chilly range, offering a muted and gray start to the day. The air feels damp and heavy, and there's a distinct damp chill in the breeze that's picking up strength as it comes off Lake Michigan. As the day unfolds, expect that patchy fog to give way to rain showers, with cloudy skies dominating the overhead views. A high in the upper 50s is on tap, alongside gusty southeast winds that will add a blustery feel to the scene. Throughout the day, a likelihood of showers intensifies into the evening, with thunderstorms expected as the temperature only creeps slightly into the mid-50s tonight.\n\nFor those planning activities outdoors, it may be wise to choose sheltered pursuits today. The beach, while beautiful in its own muted way, may not be ideal, especially as wave conditions could stir up as the winds increase. Attire should include waterproof jackets and perhaps sturdy shoes, given the rain anticipated throughout the day. This weather is perfectly characteristic of late fall in the Midwest, where cool, wet days remind us that winter is around the corner. Enjoy indoor activities, like visiting local museums or cozy cafes, as the weather encourages a retreat from the chill outside.",
