    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a chilly scene, with the temperature hovering in the low 50s, accompanied by a noticeable level of humidity that contributes to a damp, European-style coolness. The blustery winds, gusting from the southeast, create a brisk atmosphere, making it feel even cooler along the lakefront. As dusk approaches, clouds loom thickly overhead, enhancing the gray, moody ambiance of the day. For the rest of the afternoon, there\u2019s a 30% chance of rain, with thick cloud cover expected to dominate the sky, leading into a 100% likelihood of rain tonight. As temperatures settle in the high 40s, expect rainfall amounts to reach up to an inch.\n\nWaves along the beach may be moderate, driven by the sustained winds, making them suitable primarily for watching rather than swimming. Given the impending rain and chilly weather, it\u2019s advisable to don a warm jacket, perhaps layered with a light sweater, and remember to pack an umbrella if venturing outdoors. While the temperatures are typical for November in this region, the dreary conditions are less inviting for outdoor activities. This is an opportune time for indoor pursuits, be it reading a book at home, visiting a local caf\u00e9, or enjoying a meal with friends. Given that today is just a regular Tuesday and not a holiday, the focus shifts to finding comfort indoors as the weather takes a turn toward the wet.",
