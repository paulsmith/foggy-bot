    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Evanston, the weather presents a rather cool and cloudy scene, with temperatures hovering in the low 50s. The gentle north-northwest winds add a crispness to the air, creating a slightly chilly atmosphere. The forecast indicates temperatures will continue to fall, providing a perfect setting for a cozy afternoon.\n\nAs clouds linger overhead, the outlook suggests that the evening will bring more clouds with temperatures dipping to the mid-40s, accompanied by virtually still air. With no precipitation in sight and the water conditions appearing relatively calm, it\u2019s an ideal time for beach walks, though beachgoers might prefer a light jacket or sweater. As we find ourselves in mid-November, these temperatures are typical for the season in this region, inviting thoughts of upcoming holiday festivities while embodying the true essence of a Chicago late autumn day.",
