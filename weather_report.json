    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Evanston, current conditions reveal a crisp, damp atmosphere with the temperature hovering in the upper 40s. A gentle breeze sweeps through, raising the humidity just enough to keep the air feeling a tad heavy. The day begins under a blanket of clouds, but the forecast promises a transition, with mostly sunny skies rolling in later, peaking near the mid-50s in the afternoon. Tonight, the calm will continue with clarity and a lower temperature settling around the low 40s.\n\nThe appearance of the beach this morning, though somewhat grey and dreary, hints at the potential for a more pleasant afternoon. Wave conditions remain mild, providing a serene backdrop, yet caution is advisable for those venturing into the water. Regarding attire, layering is key; a light jacket would suffice for the morning chill, but as the sun makes its presence known, lighter clothing will be comfortable for the day. As we sit in early November, temperatures are in line with seasonal expectations, and the weather may inspire a variety of outdoor activities. A stroll along the shoreline, some leisure time at the park, or even an outdoor caf\u00e9 visit could be delightful as the sun graces the skies later on.",
