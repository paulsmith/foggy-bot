    "weather_report": "Currently in Evanston, the temperature hovers in the low teens, creating a crisp and cool atmosphere, accented by a clear night sky. With winds howling from the west northwest, gusts reach fierce speeds, and the wind chill bites even deeper, diving to potentially -13 degrees overnight. As we gaze into the early hours of Thursday, expect mostly sunny conditions but with highs only in the mid-teens, maintaining that sharp chill. \n\nThe beach reflects a stark, serene beauty under the moonlight, but the winter air commands respect. The waves on Lake Michigan, while not mentioned directly, are likely tempered as the wind ebbs and flows, offering a quiet power against the shore. Expect no precipitation, though the air feels dry and biting, suitable for bundling up in winter layers. With the season at mid-December, these temperatures fall right in line with typical winter conditions for this region. While the weather might not be inviting for outdoor activities, a walk on the beach, clad in warm winter attire, could provide a moment of tranquility amidst the brisk air, perfect for seasonal reflection or a brief adventure under the stars.",
