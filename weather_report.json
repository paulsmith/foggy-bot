    "weather_report": "In Evanston, current conditions are quite chilly as temperatures hover in the low 20s, accompanied by a brisk wind that sends chills down your spine. The air is thick with clouds, lending a muted, gray sky that suggests the night ahead may deliver some snow, with a chance beginning after sunset. This evening, temperatures are expected to rise slightly, reaching the mid-20s, but don\u2019t expect much warmth as gusts from the northeast could reach up to 30 miles per hour. Precipitation is likely, with a 50% chance of snow, potentially accumulating less than half an inch.\n\nLooking forward to Monday, the snowy conditions will persist with a high near 30 degrees. Expect a lively, blustery day, as winds from the north whip about, creating a bracing atmosphere. There\u2019s an 80% chance of snow, with accumulations anticipated to be between one and two inches, adding to the wintery landscape. With temperatures falling during the afternoon, the overall ambiance feels quite raw, typical for a January in the Midwest. Dress warmly, favoring layers, shovels, and sturdy footwear if venturing outside, as conditions might make walking tricky. Given the likelihood of winter weather, it might be best to remain cozy indoors, perhaps indulging in a warm beverage or planning a movie night\u2014activities well-suited for a cold, snowy evening in this beloved lakeside town.",
