    "weather_report": "Today in Evanston, conditions are characterized by a chilly atmosphere, with temperatures hovering in the low 40s. The air feels damp and the blustery winds from the east bring an added bite, making it less than inviting for outdoor activities without appropriate attire. Residents can expect a mostly cloudy day with the possibility of light rain, particularly before early morning, and the forecast hints at a slight chance of precipitation persisting through the evening.\n\nWith the lake waves likely stirred by the wind, it\u2019s a day best suited for a light jacket and perhaps an umbrella, particularly later when showers may occur. The season being late February usually brings these cool, murky days, typical for the region. Activity-wise, it may be a good time for cozy indoor pursuits, perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9 or museum, rather than venturing out to the chilly shore. As we\u2019re still in winter, it's essential to dress warmly for whatever plans one may gather today, especially with the temperatures on the rise toward the low 30s tonight.",
