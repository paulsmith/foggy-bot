    "weather_report": "This evening in Evanston, the weather presents a chilly, damp atmosphere marked by the gentle patter of patchy drizzle expected to ease before 11 PM. As temperatures hover in the low 50s, a noticeable humidity blankets the air, heightening that somewhat brisk edge. The northwest wind, while not fierce, carries a hint of chill, making the overall feel less inviting in this overcast setting.\n\nAs we look towards tomorrow, expect a continuation of the cloudy conditions with a high only reaching into the low 50s, complemented by a light, north-northwest breeze. Wave conditions along Lake Michigan may be subdued tonight but could stir slightly with the breeze tomorrow, creating a mildly choppy surface. For those heading out, a warm jacket and perhaps a rain-resistant layer would serve well, as the typical late autumn chill permeates the region. Given the evening and weather pairing, indoor activities like visiting a caf\u00e9 or catching a local show might be more enjoyable than braving the damp coastal winds.",
