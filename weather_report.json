    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the night brings with it a cool and crisp ambiance, with the temperature lingering in the low 40s, accompanied by a brisk breeze that makes it feel more invigorating. The skies are overcast, setting a subdued tone as nighttime descends, while wind gusts whip through at a spirited pace, creating a blustery atmosphere along the shore. As we look towards the morrow, expect a mostly cloudy day ahead with temperatures peaking in the mid 30s by afternoon; these conditions will likely keep things feeling chilly, especially with a light, persistent wind.\n\nWave conditions at Lake Michigan could be slightly choppy given the winds, so care should be taken for waterfront strolls or any outdoor activities around the beach. There\u2019s no significant precipitation expected overnight or throughout Tuesday, making it a dry but brisk outing. As you venture out, layering up with a good coat and perhaps a scarf or hat would be a sensible choice, as the cool air might nip at exposed skin. \n\nGiven that we are in December in the Midwest, these temperatures align closely with seasonal norms, reflecting a typical chill for this time of year. While outdoor recreational activities might be limited due to the coolness, a cozy day indoors with warm beverages or preparations for the upcoming holidays could be just the right way to enjoy this wintry weather.",
