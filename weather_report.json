    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois, reveal a rather balmy night with temperatures resting comfortably in the low 60s, accompanied by a damp atmosphere. The sky is blanketed in cloud cover, creating a thick, muted ambiance that blankets the beach as it draws closer to Lake Michigan. Wind gusts are fierce, swirling with a notable intensity, hinting at the approaching storm. Rain is predicted to make its entrance shortly, likely before dawn, with precipitation chances soaring to 100%. As the night progresses, temperatures are expected to dip slightly before warming a bit again overnight, setting the stage for a cool and rainy Monday.\n\nLooking ahead, tomorrow promises an equally drizzly day, where rain and the possibility of thunderstorms will linger amidst a cloudy sky, with temperatures peaking in the upper 60s before falling off in the afternoon. The wave conditions on the lake, influenced by the robust winds and imminent rainfall, will likely become tumultuous. Given the weather, it would be wise to dress in layers, incorporating waterproof attire, and perhaps an umbrella, to navigate through a day that will feel particularly dreary for this time of year in the Midwest, especially as we move deeper into November. Outdoor activities might be better left for another day, favoring indoor ventures or cozying up in familiar settings given the forecast of impending rain and cool temperatures typical for this season.",
