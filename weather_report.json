    "weather_report": "As evening settles over Evanston, the current scene features chilly temperatures registering in the low 20s, accompanied by a pleasant crispness, making it feel quite brisk outside. The sky is predominantly draped in clouds, hinting at a mostly cloudy atmosphere with no signs of precipitation. Tonight, expect partly cloudy conditions and a drop in temperatures to around 14 degrees, bolstered by a west wind that, while gentle now, is set to strengthen, creating wind chill values that could plunge to as low as zero.\n\nLooking ahead to Saturday, a transformation in the weather is anticipated with bright, sunny skies gracing the area. The mercury is expected to peak near 23 degrees, before settling back to the low 20s in the afternoon. This is typical for a late November day in Nebraska, where such cool temperatures are par for the course. With no significant wave activity reported and the absence of precipitation, this may well be a fine opportunity for outdoor activities, especially for those with a taste for brisk walks along the shoreline or a spirited run. Ensure to dress warmly, layering up to combat the chill, and perhaps don a scarf to shield against the blustery conditions.",
