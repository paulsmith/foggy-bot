    "weather_report": "The current weather in Evanston is characterized by a cool and markedly blustery afternoon, with temperatures hovering in the mid to high 40s. The air carries a brisk chill, as the winds howl along the lakeshore, creating an invigorating yet slightly uncomfortable atmosphere. As we move through the day, we can expect scattered rain showers to roll in, with thicker clouds overriding the skyline, pushing temperatures down to the low 40s. The chance of precipitation stands at 40%, with minor rainfall accumulations likely.\n\nAs evening approaches, the possibility of scattered rain and snow showers increases, with temperatures dipping to around freezing. Wind gusts may peak at around 30 mph, adding to the wintery feel. It\u2019s a day best suited for warm layers; consider donning a thick sweater or jacket with a waterproof outer layer to shield against the elements. This time of year, mid-November, typically sees such chilliness along the shores of Lake Michigan, making today\u2019s conditions somewhat characteristic of the season. With that in mind, outdoor activities may be limited; cozying up indoors or enjoying a hot beverage near a window might be more inviting as the weather turns.",
