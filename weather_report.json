    "weather_report": "As night envelops Evanston, current conditions reveal a chilly atmosphere, with the temperature hovering in the low 20s and a refreshing breeze from the west-northwest adding to the crispness of the evening air. The clear sky allows for a wide expanse of stars, evoking a serene beauty, though the winds are brisk and may feel a tad biting at times. Looking ahead, tonight's forecast suggests partly cloudy skies and a low near 19, with winds calming to a gentle pace, providing a moment of respite from the day's fiercer gusts. \n\nCome Monday, a slight chance of snow showers teases the region, though the day will likely start with a partly sunny stretch ahead of temperatures climbing to the high 20s. Given the season, these conditions are par for the course in early December, as the air maintains a distinctly wintry bite that aligns with typical Lake Michigan weather. Ideal for bundling up, a heavy coat, scarf, and gloves are advisable for anyone venturing outside. Despite the brisk air, those seeking solace by the shore might enjoy a brisk walk along the beach or a cozy evening nestled inside a nearby caf\u00e9, embracing the tranquility of the season.",
