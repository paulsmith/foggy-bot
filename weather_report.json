    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather sets a chilly scene with temperatures in the low 20s and gusty winds creating a brisk feel, making it necessary to bundle up for any outdoor activities. Light snow is falling, adding a delicate layer to the landscape but contributing to the overall dreariness of the day. As we head into the afternoon, intermittent snow showers are expected to continue, though the cloud cover will keep the high around the mid-20s. The winds from the west will remain strong, adding a bluster that could turn the chill into biting wind chills, dropping temperatures further into the single digits by tonight.\n\nThe beach offers a stark view; the waves are likely gentle, but with the gusty winds, they could pick up a bit. The color of the water, muted under the cloudy sky, echoes the coldness felt around the area. Those venturing outside should wear warm layers and consider a snow-friendly activity, perhaps a brisk walk or a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 afterward. As it's not a major holiday today, it could be a tranquil time to enjoy the onset of a Midwestern winter, punctuated by the seasonal chill that feels characteristic of this time of year in Illinois.",
