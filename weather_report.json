    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a crisp and cool atmosphere, with temperatures hovering in the low 40s complemented by a blustery wind. The overcast skies contribute to an impression of muted brightness, and the waves along Lake Michigan are likely choppy, reflecting the intensity of the gusty breezes. As the night progresses, temperatures are expected to dip, becoming slightly chillier but with a gradual warming trend into the early morning.\n\nLooking ahead to Monday, the forecast suggests more mostly cloudy skies with a high nearing the mid-50s. Winds will calm to a breezy pace, offering a slight reprieve from the current gales. There is no precipitation expected, making outdoor plans feasible, though it's wise to layer up with a heavier jacket to embrace the seasonal chill. The coastal conditions and overall weather do not align with any major holiday, but the aspects of late February perfectly suit winter strolls by the beach or perhaps even some light outdoor winter sports. Enjoy the day wrapped in warmth as winter begins its slow retreat.",
