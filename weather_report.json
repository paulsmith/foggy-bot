    "weather_report": "This evening in Evanston, the atmosphere feels pleasantly cool with dense clouds casting a muted sky. Current temperatures are in the low 60s, combined with a gentle breeze that brings a soothing quality to the air, though it may feel slightly damp. As the night progresses, there\u2019s a slight chance of light rain showers before 8 PM, giving way to a potentially clearer night, with temperatures dropping to the mid 40s.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, expect more substantial rainfall with showers forecasted to arrive after 10 AM, likely making for a rather gray and wet day, particularly as winds shift to the east and could gust up to 30 mph. Despite the moisture and chill, the air remains invigorating, typical for mid-November here. It\u2019s advisable to don a warm, waterproof jacket and sturdy shoes for outdoor ventures, as the bluster and potential for puddles could make navigation tricky. \n\nThese conditions lend themselves well to cozy indoor activities, perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9 or bookstore, as the beach and lakefront might be less inviting with choppy waters and looming rain. There are no notable holidays or events today, but with Thanksgiving approaching, the festive spirit may soon be in the air.",
