    "weather_report": "In Evanston tonight, we're experiencing a cool and damp ambiance as temperatures settle into the upper 50s. The air feels humid and thick, brewing a tempestuous backdrop as a howling south wind sweeps in. Expect rain showers and the possibility of thunderstorms as the evening progresses, with precipitation likely, making it quite uninviting for outdoor activities. As the clock ticks closer to midnight, conditions will remain cloudy, with total rainfall amounts potentially reaching over half an inch.\n\nLooking ahead to Monday, the forecast promises more rain, especially before mid-afternoon, and a chance of thunderstorms. Daytime highs will hover around the mid-60s, tapering as the day advances, complemented by a brisk breeze. While the waves on Lake Michigan may rise and churn in this gusty weather, it\u2019s a day best suited for cozy indoor activities rather than a stroll by the shore. For those venturing out, layering with a waterproof jacket and comfortable footwear will be essential. Given that we find ourselves in early November, these conditions reflect the transitional autumn weather typical for the region, where one must brace for cooler, precipitation-laden days.",
