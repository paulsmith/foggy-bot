    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston paint a chilly scene, with temperatures hovering around the mid-30s and a brisk breeze sweeping in from the west-southwest at a fierce pace. The air feels crisp and cool, making it a day for bundled jackets as you step out towards the beach. Despite the mostly cloudy skies, the afternoon will bring some sunshine, although temperatures are expected to dip into the low 30s as the day progresses. Tonight will see more clouds, with the temperature dropping into the mid-teens, so outdoor plans should wrap up early.\n\nAs for wave conditions along Lake Michigan, expect some activity; the winds are stirring the water, but precipitation remains absent, lending to a clearer view of the stunning lake, albeit slightly gray. Given these conditions, warm layers are essential, along with sturdy footwear if you plan to venture down to the beach. While the chill encourages contemplation over outdoor activities, the prevailing weather invites you to enjoy a cozy afternoon indoors or perhaps enjoy the scenic views along the shoreline if you're suitably attired. Remember, this day falls gently into the winter season, where such temperatures are typical for these parts, yet they still reinforce the idyllic charm of Evanston during this time of year.",
