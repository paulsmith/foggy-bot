    "weather_report": "In Evanston, current conditions reveal a chilly atmosphere with temperatures hovering in the mid-teens and a brisk, howling wind that brings added intensity to the cold. The air feels invigorating yet biting, setting the stage for a night marked by mostly clear skies and temperatures dipping to around 11 degrees. Wind chill values could plummet as low as 1 degree, calling for a careful approach to outdoor ventures.\n\nAs we look forward to tomorrow, expect a sunny day, albeit with the temperature struggling to reach near the freezing mark, only climbing to the high 20s in the afternoon. The delightful sunshine will contrast with the chill, and gentle winds from the west will provide a soothing touch for those bundled up. Wave activity along Lake Michigan is likely to be moderate, inviting those adventurous souls to explore the beach near the shoreline. Given the current winter season, temperatures are falling well within the expected range, signaling typical Midwestern winter weather rather than any unusual extremes. Be sure to wrap up warmly in layers, consider a sturdy hat and gloves, and perhaps plan for some outdoor activities such as a brisk walk along the beach or a visit to nearby parks.",
