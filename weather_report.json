    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the midday scene is characterized by cool temperatures lingering in the low 20s, coupled with a breezy wind from the northwest that adds a decidedly brisk edge to the atmosphere. The sky is overcast, casting a muted light over the beach, where the gentle lapping of Lake Michigan's waves creates a soothing backdrop. While you may catch a glimpse of sun later, the temperature is set to rise slightly, maxing out around the upper 20s this afternoon before retreating back down at night. \n\nConditions are not particularly inviting for outdoor enjoyment; however, the crisp air is invigorating for a brisk walk along the waterfront or perhaps a quick beach clean-up with a few friends. Moderate wind may warrant a light jacket, especially alongside thicker layers to ensure warmth. The lack of precipitation is a silver lining, providing an opportunity to embrace the outdoors, albeit briefly. For those relishing the season, it feels like a typical chilly December day in the Midwest, with holiday cheer just around the corner.",
