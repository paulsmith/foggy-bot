    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the weather this afternoon presents a chilly and overcast scene, with current temperatures hovering in the mid to upper 30s. A brisk, gusty wind from the southwest adds a sharpness to the air, making it feel increasingly nippy. As the clouds linger, the chance of rain showers remains slight, blending into a gray palette above, which carries with it an atmosphere of quiet contemplation. The waves churn lightly against the shore of Lake Michigan, creating a gentle soundtrack of nature\u2019s hum, though conditions may not be ideal for beachgoers.\n\nTonight, expect temperatures to dip further into the mid-30s, with a gentle shift in wind direction towards the northwest, providing a slightly calmer evening affair. Dressing warmly is recommended, perhaps layering up with a sturdy jacket, gloves, and a scarf to fend off the chill. Given the wintry season in this northern part of the Midwest, these temperatures fall within the typical range for late December, suggesting it is indeed a season of frost and shorter days. For those looking to brave the elements, a stroll along the beach could prove refreshing, though staying bundled will be key for a comfortable outing.",
