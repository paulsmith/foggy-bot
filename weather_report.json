    "weather_report": "As the sun sets on Evanston, the temperature sits in the low 20s, bringing a crisp chill to the air, complemented by a light hum of wind creating a brisk atmosphere. With partly cloudy skies overhead, the evening feels invigorating yet cold, particularly as wind gusts add a sharp edge to the air, making it feel bitterly cool outdoors. Tonight, clear skies are expected, dropping to a low around the teens, which could create wind chill values close to -2, resulting in a biting cold that will require warm attire if venturing outside.\n\nTomorrow promises mostly sunny conditions with temperatures barely escaping the mid-20s, making it a typical late November day for the region. The wind will continue, though slightly lighter than today, maintaining a breezy feel that will be particularly pronounced at the shore. Expect gentle waves along Lake Michigan, though conditions won't be ideal for swimming or recreational water activities. For those heading outdoors, layered clothing and winter accessories such as hats and gloves are highly recommended to negate the chill. As we approach the festive season, outdoor strolls or quick errands in the winter air might be appealing, but be sure to dress warmly to enjoy the late autumn scenery comfortably.",
