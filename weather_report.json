    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston paint a cool and breezy picture, with temperatures cooling into the low 50s and humidity lending a slightly damp edge to the evening air. The wind is blowing gently from the east, providing a refreshing chill, especially as night takes hold. Expect a tranquil night ahead with partly cloudy skies and a low slipping down to around 47 degrees, allowing for a crisp yet comfortable environment. \n\nLooking forward to Saturday, the day will usher in partly sunny skies and a high nearing the upper 50s, with a light southeast breeze picking up as the day progresses. The waves on Lake Michigan may offer a soothing sound, but there\u2019s no precipitation in sight for now, keeping the atmosphere clear for outdoor plans. Given the seasonal chill typical for mid-November in the region, dressing in layers is advisable\u2014think warm clothing paired with a light jacket to fend off the cool breeze. Outdoor activities such as a stroll along the beach or park should be delightful, inviting locals to enjoy the fresh air and dynamic lakefront, especially before the weather turns more wintry in the coming weeks.",
