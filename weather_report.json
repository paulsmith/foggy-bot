    "weather_report": "A damp chill envelops Evanston this morning, with temperatures settling comfortably in the mid 30s and a noteworthy breeze adding a bite to the air. The day begins under a blanket of clouds and patchy fog, leaving the atmosphere feeling heavy yet still, with gentle winds whispering from the south-southwest. Wave conditions on Lake Michigan are moderate but steady, with the water reflecting the overcast skies in a muted palette. As the day unfolds, expect a transition to partly sunny skies by afternoon, bringing a promise of warmth, with highs reaching near the upper 40s\u2014a touch more inviting than the early dawn.\n\nWhile precipitation won\u2019t be a worry, visibility may remain limited into the morning due to residual fog. Dress in layers to adapt to the fluctuating temperatures, opting for warm attire that withstands the briskness of the wind. Although not typical for the end of November, the highs remind us that more temperate days can occur even as winter approaches. Ideal activities might include a brisk walk along the shoreline or simply enjoying the coziness of local cafes, as this day presents the perfect opportunity to embrace the soothing ambiance of the season. As we gather together in the spirit of the holiday season, let's remember that tomorrow is indeed a celebration, ushering in a hopeful time for family and friends.",
