    "weather_report": "The atmosphere in Evanston this early morning is marked by a heavy overcast, accompanied by a persistent drizzle that is set to intensify. Current temperatures hover in the mid-60s, creating a damp and humid feel to the air, while gusty winds from the south are shaking the branches and rustling through the leaves. Residents can expect a full day of rain, particularly before 10 AM, with a likelihood of showers continuing into the afternoon. Highs will reach the upper 60s, but with a noticeable drop to the mid-60s later in the day as the weather front moves through. \n\nThe beach, typically a lively gathering spot, is under a blanket of gloom, interrupted only by the occasional burst of wind. Given the incoming weather and persistent rain, outdoor activities are best postponed until the skies clear. For those venturing out, a waterproof jacket and sturdy shoes are essential to navigate the slick paths and unexpected puddles. With rain forecasted throughout the day, it\u2019s more suited for cozy indoor pursuits such as visiting local caf\u00e9s or cultural spots than for beach strolls or picnics. As this weather unfolds on the eve of the holiday season, it invites a reflective mood, perfect for curling up with a good book or catching up with friends indoors.",
