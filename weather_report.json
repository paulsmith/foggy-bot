    "weather_report": "Currently in Evanston, conditions are distinctly brisk, with temperatures in the upper 40s and a notable cloud cover that lends a somewhat grey tone to the evening sky. The wind is quite vigorous, presenting a strong push from the southwest that adds a chill to the air, making it feel cooler than the thermometer suggests. As we look ahead, tonight will remain mostly cloudy, with temperatures expected to dip to the low 30s before gently rising again as the night progresses. Tomorrow, expect similar cloudiness with daytime highs only reaching into the mid 30s. Overall, it feels rather chilly, typical for early December.\n\nFor outdoor enthusiasts, today\u2019s beach scene may be uninviting due to the cooler air and hearty winds, while wave conditions are likely moderate\u2014a mix that could create some surf. As for attire, layering with warm clothing is highly recommended; a thick coat, hats, and scarves will provide comfort against the chill. Though today is not a holiday, this December evening carries the promise of winter's embrace, leaving plenty of opportunities for light outdoor activities when the weather allows.",
