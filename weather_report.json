    "weather_report": "Evanston is waking up to a decidedly chilly morning with temperatures in the low 30s and a brisk, howling wind sending shivers through the air. The clouds loom overhead, shrouding the sky in a gray haze, but thankfully, conditions remain dry with no precipitation expected today. As the day unfolds, expect the high to hover near the mid 30s, giving way to a slightly more comfortable afternoon as temperatures settle around 34 degrees. Tonight, temperatures will dip further into the upper 20s, complemented by a gentle night breeze.\n\nThe chilly air and overcast skies impart an uninviting atmosphere for outdoor activities, making it best to bundle up in warm layers, including a sturdy coat, scarves, and gloves. The winds are sure to kick up some waves along the shoreline, hinting at a subdued ocean with roiling waters that suit no recreational swimming. Given the seasonal shift towards winter and the current forecasts, today's temperatures reflect a typical day for early December in this region, where the cold crispness reaffirms the approaching holidays. As we sit on the brink of the festive season, it's a fine time to cozy up indoors with a warm beverage or perhaps take a brisk walk along the shoreline to brace against the chill.",
