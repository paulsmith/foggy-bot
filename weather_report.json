    "weather_report": "In Evanston today, the weather is characterized by a brisk chill, with temperatures hovering in the mid 40s, wrapping the lakeshore in a cool embrace. Skies are mostly cloudy, though there\u2019s a hint of sunshine breaking through, as the gentle whispers of wind from the west southwest stir the air, adding an invigorating chill that elevates the overall experience. As we head into the afternoon, conditions are expected to shift, with scattered rain showers anticipated after 3 PM. The high will reach near 48, but a gradual drop will lead most to feel the chill intensify.\n\nWith the evening approaching, watch for the clouds to gather further, ushering in a likely mix of scattered snow showers during the night. Wind speeds will maintain a fierce quality, gusting up to 30 mph, contributing to a biting feel as temperatures dip to around the low 30s. While little to no accumulation is expected from this light snowfall, your outer layers will be necessary to stave off the evening\u2019s chill. Given the seasonal context of late November in the Midwest, these temperatures are typical yet certainly remind us that winter is at the door. Ideal activities might include a cozy afternoon indoors or a brisk waterfront walk clad in sturdy jackets, before settling in for a warm evening.",
