    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Evanston, the air carries a biting chill with temperatures hovering in the low teens, creating a crisp and cool atmosphere ideal for bundling up. The clear but cold conditions remain unmarred by any precipitation, allowing for an unbroken view of the night sky, though the wind howls fiercely, reminding us of winter's breath. In the coming hours, expect partly cloudy skies with temperatures dipping to around ten degrees, accompanied by a gentle breeze from the north-northwest.\n\nTomorrow, a hint of warmth returns, bringing partly sunny skies and highs in the upper 20s, though it still feels quite brisk with the wind likely to create noticeable chill across any exposed skin. Wave conditions on Lake Michigan tonight are likely modest; however, as winds remain strong, it\u2019s wise to anticipate some choppy waters for anyone considering a late-night stroll along the shore. It\u2019s a good night to curl up indoors with a warm drink rather than provocatively venturing outside; however, outdoor enthusiasts may find tomorrow more inviting for brisk walks or enjoying the winter landscape. As we drift toward the holiday season, the chill in the air reminds us that the festive spirit is just around the corner.",
