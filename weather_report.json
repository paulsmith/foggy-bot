    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current conditions reveal a wintry chill, with temperatures lingering in the mid 20s, accompanied by a substantial wind creating a brisk feel that makes stepping outdoors a biting experience. The sky is cloaked in clouds, casting a dim light, and the gusty winds are quite fierce, cascading from the south-southwest, making the beach appear rugged and windswept. As we look ahead to the forecast, the weather promises a transition through the night into a mostly cloudy morning, with the low teetering around the low 20s, progressively rising as temperatures inch towards the mid 20s. \n\nOn Wednesday, expect scattered rain and snow showers rolling in around mid-afternoon, signaling a high near the upper 30s before dipping back toward the mid 30s later in the day, with another round of strong winds expected to whip through at 20 to 25 mph and possible gusts reaching up to 50 mph. Currently, precipitation appears minimal, but with a 50% chance as the day unfolds, it's prudent to have an umbrella at the ready. Given the season, winter here is decidedly robust, making layered attire essential\u2014think a snug winter coat, thick gloves, and a warm hat. With the chill in the air and the impending snow showers, it may not be the most inviting day for outdoor activities, making indoor pursuits like visiting a local caf\u00e9 or museum a more agreeable option.",
