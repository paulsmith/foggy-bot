    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reflect a chilly and overcast morning, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s. The atmosphere feels damp and crisp, setting the stage for the anticipated winter snow. Throughout the day, expect shades of gray as snow clouds gather, leading to likely snowfall later on. By afternoon, temperatures may dip slightly to around 31, accompanied by a blustery north wind that could elevate gusts to a fierce 40 mph. The chances for new snow accumulation sit at 80%, with about an inch expected, likely creating a wintry scene along the beach and Lake Michigan.\n\nAs evening approaches, skies will transition to partly cloudy, with temperatures dropping to the low teens and a gentler north-northwest breeze. The wave conditions will likely be choppy given the gusty winds, so caution is advised for those wishing to venture near the water. The weather calls for warm layers, including a sturdy winter coat, gloves, and a hat to guard against the biting wind. Given the season, this weather aligns with typical December chill, making it ideal for cozy indoor activities or wintry walks for the adventurous. Overall, today, December 20, is pleasant for anyone seeking the holiday spirit amidst a picturesque, snow-laden winter landscape.",
