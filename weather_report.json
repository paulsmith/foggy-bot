    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston suggest a chilly atmosphere, where temperatures hover in the low 30s accompanied by a damp and biting breeze. The air is thick with the scent of impending snow as well, as the area experiences a gentle yet consistent snowfall, with the possibility of drizzle adding to the wintery mix. As residents step outside, they\u2019ll encounter a stark landscape defined by low visibility and a pervasive cloud cover that seems to dim the usual vibrancy of the shoreline.\n\nLooking ahead to the day, snow showers are expected to continue throughout the morning, eventually giving way to colder temperatures in the afternoon. Winds will pick up as the day goes on, shifting to the north and gaining intensity, leaving an unmistakable chill in the air. Any accumulation of snow will likely be minor, but still enough to paint a delicate blanket over the landscape. Given the seasonal transition, the low 30s feel typical for a December day in this region, though the damp air may make it feel even colder. For those venturing outdoors, it would be wise to bundle up in warm layers, perhaps donning a heavy coat, gloves, and a hat. Outdoor activities may be limited, but a brisk walk along the shore might provide a refreshing respite, especially for those who cherish the serene beauty of winter's embrace.",
