    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly and blustery night, with temperatures pouring in the low 40s and a moisture-laden air that lends a slightly muggy feel. The wind whips from the southeast, creating a gusty atmosphere that underscores the partly cloudy skies above. As we look towards the morning, expect mostly cloudy conditions to prevail, with temperatures dipping just a few degrees lower overnight. Tomorrow, a chance of rain creeps in after 5 PM, but for now, the evening remains relatively dry with only a slight chance of any sprinkles.\n\nGiven the current conditions, it's advisable to don layers tonight\u2014perhaps a warm jacket or sweater along with a sturdy pair of shoes if venturing out. While the gusty winds may create some wave activity on Lake Michigan, those looking ahead to the day tomorrow should prepare for increased chances of rain later on. As we inch further into November, these temperatures resonate with typical autumn weather in this region, setting the scene for cozy indoor pursuits or brisk strolls along the beach as the sun peeks through the clouds.",
