    "weather_report": "Currently in Evanston, temperatures hover just below freezing, lending a distinctly chilly feel to the day. The air is heavy with an unmistakable dampness, contributing to a somewhat crisp atmosphere. Today, expect a transition towards partly sunny skies, while a gentle breeze from the west northwest promises to bring some calm to the morning chill, with gusts potentially adding a touch of vigor throughout the day. Temperatures are projected to rise slightly, peaking near the upper 20s, making it a day where layering will be key for comfort.\n\nAs far as wave conditions go, with the lake\u2019s chill, one can anticipate a brisk and frothy surface, typical for this season along the shores of Lake Michigan. No precipitation is expected, allowing for a clear evening as the sun sets, leading to temperatures dropping to around 20 degrees. Dressing warmly in layers is advisable, perhaps a thick coat with a hat and gloves, to navigate the brisk conditions comfortably. While the chill is expected this time of year in the Midwest, the pleasant break in snow and clouds makes for a lovely opportunity for a brisk walk along the beach or a quick visit to local stores and cafes, all while keeping warmth in mind.",
