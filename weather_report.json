    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the current weather presents a rather damp and dreary scene, with a temperature nestled in the upper 40s, coupled with a heavy, muggy atmosphere thanks to high humidity levels. The winds are quite gusty, sweeping in from the southeast, creating a restless environment as light rain and fog envelop the area. Residents can expect this precipitation to continue overnight, with rain showers likely tapering off around dawn before a drizzle prevails, keeping the conditions overcast and chilly.\n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, there\u2019s a glimmer of hope as the day starts with a possibility of patchy drizzle. A mix of clouds and sun is anticipated, with afternoon temperatures reaching into the upper 50s before cooling down slightly. Wind gusts may become quite vigorous, hitting highs in the 30s, adding to the briskness of the day. Ideal attire would involve layering up with a light jacket or raincoat, paired with sturdy shoes\u2014especially if venturing along the shoreline where the waves could churn restlessly due to the developing counter-current. Given that it\u2019s a weekend, indoor activities may be preferable, although if brave souls wish to explore the beachfront, a gentle walk might provide some relief from the confines of indoor spaces. The season aligns with typical November weather patterns here in the Midwest, where cool temperatures and occasional rain are expected as autumn transitions to winter.",
