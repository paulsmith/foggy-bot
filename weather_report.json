    "weather_report": "As of this evening, the weather in Evanston is marked by a cool and damp atmosphere, with temperatures lingering in the low 60s. Humidity hangs in the air, creating a slightly muggy environment, while the winds from the south whip around at a gusty pace, stirring up the shoreline and bringing an unsettled flavor to the evening. Cloud cover dominates the sky, hinting at the impending rain that is forecasted to roll in shortly, accompanied by thunder and lightning, as showers become more frequent overnight.\n\nTonight's heaviest precipitation will set in just before midnight, with expectations of significant rainfall, possibly accumulating up to three-quarters of an inch by morning. This rainy pattern will extend into Monday, keeping cloudy skies overhead and temperatures hovering in the mid to upper 60s during the day before dipping into the lower 60s. With substantial moisture in the air and the rough wave conditions likely due to the wind and rain, it's best to prepare for a wet day ahead. \n\nAppropriate attire would include water-resistant layers and sturdy footwear as outdoor activities will be challenging under these circumstances. Given the time of year, this weather is rather typical for early November in the Midwest, with cool temperatures and increased precipitation\u2014certainly a hallmark of the season. Indoor activities, such as visiting local cafes, exploring museums, or enjoying a cozy evening indoors with a good book, may be preferable amid this less than inviting forecast.",
