    "weather_report": "Evanston, Illinois, is currently experiencing a chilly evening, with temperatures dipping into the lower 40s. The air carries a gentle dampness, making for a crisp and cool atmosphere under overcast skies. Winds are brisk, swaying the tall grasses and ruffling the surface of Lake Michigan, where wave activity is likely moderate but manageable. As night falls, a slight chance of snow remains in the forecast, though any accumulation will be minimal. Tomorrow, conditions will remain mostly cloudy with temperatures peaking in the mid-40s before settling to a cooler close in the afternoon. \n\nGiven the chill in the air and the possibility of light snowfall, a warm jacket, perhaps layered with a sweater, would be advisable for anyone venturing outside. The scene is reminiscent of late fall in the Midwest, typical for this time of year, where a somber clarity hangs over the landscape. Ideal activities would include a cozy evening indoors or a walk on the beach, allowing for the fresh air while wrapped warmly against the chill.",
