    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Evanston, the current conditions paint a scene of chill and bluster. With temperatures in the low 40s and a blustery wind from the northwest, the atmosphere is distinctly cold and damp, lending itself to an uninviting feel outside. The sky, cloaked in thick clouds, enhances the somber mood, suggesting that the weather will remain overcast through the night. Expect a drop in temperatures as we approach a low near 39, while the winds persist at a breezy pace, intermittently gusting, which adds to the sharpness in the air. \n\nTomorrow isn't shaping up to be much warmer, remaining mostly cloudy with highs climbing only to around 45, before settling back into the 40s in the afternoon. The wave conditions along the shoreline may stir up some notable movement in Lake Michigan, creating a choppy surface that could deter casual beachgoers. As for attire, warm layers are essential along with a windbreaker to fend off that penetrating chill. While these late November temperatures fit the season well, they certainly evoke a sense of winter's quick approach. In this setting, outdoor plans might be best suited for brief excursions rather than long outings, perhaps a brisk stroll along the lakefront to appreciate nature\u2019s beauty while bundled up, especially on the eve of Thanksgiving, marking a time for gathering and reflection.",
