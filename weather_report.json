    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a distinctly damp and cool atmosphere, with light rain adding to the brisk feel. The temperature hovers in the upper 50s, creating a rather sticky sensation as the humidity lingers, and the wind whistles fiercely at close to 54 miles per hour. Overnight, expect rain to persist, with temperatures gradually rising into the low 60s and a strong south-southeast breeze propelling the moisture across the area. As Tuesday approaches, the chance of rain continues, but it may relent slightly in the morning, giving way to a mostly cloudy sky, with temperatures peaking once again in the upper 50s. \n\nGiven the inclement weather, the beach scene takes on a somber tone, with high wave action potentially stirring up Lake Michigan, making it an uninviting time for activities by the shore. Those venturing outdoors should dress warmly, opting for waterproof gear to combat the rain and wind. With the climate leaning toward the cooler side typical of late fall in the Midwest, many may find this weather less than ideal for outdoor plans. As for activities, it would be wiser to seek indoor pursuits like visiting local museums or cozy cafes to escape the chill and rain. Remember, there are no major holidays on the horizon, but as we inch closer to Thanksgiving in just a few days, preparations for gatherings may begin to stir in the area.",
