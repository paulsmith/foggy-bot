    "weather_report": "The current weather in Evanston, Illinois, presents a notably damp and cool scene, with temperatures dipping into the mid 40s and a heavy blanket of fog reducing visibility along the beach. Light rain adds to the chill, creating a slightly dreary ambiance that reflects the overcast sky. Today, expect conditions to remain gloomy with persistent rain and patchy fog, while temperatures are predicted to reach a high in the low 40s. The north wind will be brisk, stirring some wave action on Lake Michigan, suggesting a blustery day ahead.\n\nAs you venture outdoors, it's advisable to dress warmly in layers, ideally donning a waterproof jacket and sturdy shoes to keep dry. The atmosphere has a raw, winter bite typical of this season in northern Illinois, although today's weather feels colder than one might anticipate for late December. Given the weather, leisurely beach walks or waterfront activities may be best replaced with indoor options. Considering today is not a holiday, but the new year approaches, you might find some comfort in cozying up with a warm drink or catching up on indoor hobbies while escaping the weather\u2019s chill.",
