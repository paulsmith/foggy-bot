    "weather_report": "This evening in Evanston brings crisp and cool conditions as the temperature hovers in the mid 20s. The air feels quite brisk, under partly cloudy skies, with a blustery wind tearing from the southeast. As night progresses, temperatures are expected to dip moderately, settling around the upper 20s, accompanied by a sustained breeze that may lead to wind chills. \n\nLooking ahead to Saturday, rain is forecasted to move in during the afternoon, with increased cloud cover and temperatures rising to a high in the upper 30s. The southeast winds will continue to be notable, gusting at times, which could increase the feeling of chill through the day. Given the likelihood of precipitation, and the beach view marred by a prevailing grayness, the landscape may appear dreary and damp. Wave conditions along Lake Michigan could become somewhat choppy, particularly with the incoming gusty breezes. As for attire, dressing in layers is recommended to mitigate the cold, with waterproof outerwear advisable for the upcoming rain. \n\nIn this season, temperatures are generally aligning with typical weather patterns for December in the Midwest, where frigid air tends to dominate. While the forecast for Saturday calls for wet weather, the evening's current chill may prompt locals to consider cozy indoor activities or perhaps a warm drink while looking out over the lake as twilight deepens.",
