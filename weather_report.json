    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois, present a crisp and cool evening with temperatures hovering in the mid-teen range. The air carries a gentle chill, made more pronounced by a brisk wind sweeping in from the northwest. Although the day is closing out partly cloudy, the outdoor scene hints at the possibility of an impending weather shift, as mostly cloudy skies will blanket the area tonight with temperatures slightly rising as the night progresses.\n\nLooking ahead, Sunday promises to be partly sunny with temperatures climbing into the low 30s, accompanied by a south wind that may generate some blustery conditions. The waves on Lake Michigan will likely be choppy, a reflection of the ongoing winds and cloud cover, which could be a bit unsettled for shoreline activities. There\u2019s no substantial precipitation expected overnight or through the day tomorrow, making for a dry but brisk outing through the holiday season. \n\nGiven the chill and wind, layering up with warm clothing is recommended\u2014think insulated jackets, hats, and gloves for any potential outdoor adventures. While the current temperatures are typical for this time of year in the Midwest, the coastal allure of the lake might draw some hearty souls out for a brisk walk or a picturesque moment by the water. With the holiday spirit in the air, it\u2019s a fine time for indoor gatherings or cozy evenings by the fire, as December days in Evanston grow shorter and colder.",
