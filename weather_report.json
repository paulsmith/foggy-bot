    "weather_report": "As the sun descends on Evanston, the evening air has turned crisp and cool, with temperatures hovering in the low 20s. The atmosphere is stirred by a brisk, blustery northwest wind, lending a bite to the already cold feeling outdoors. Currently partly cloudy, the skies are expected to shift towards a more overcast appearance as night falls, with temperatures dipping to around 13 degrees. Wind chill might make it feel as frigid as 1 degree, so venturing outside will demand warm attire to maintain comfort. \n\nFor those contemplating activities, the beach might not be the most inviting choice given the biting cold and the chilling winds from Lake Michigan. Activity on the water presents some waves, but not enough to encourage safe indulgence, particularly as the night approaches. Instead, cozying up indoors with a warm drink might be the best option. As we are a few days away from a popular holiday, the anticipation in the air adds a touch of warmth to the chilly surroundings.",
