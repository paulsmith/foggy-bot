    "weather_report": "As night falls over Evanston, the air is a chilly embrace with temperatures lingering in the mid-30s. The atmosphere is thick and damp, belying the winter season and intensifying the outdoor chill. A strong wind whips off Lake Michigan, creating a blustery feel that dances with the clouds hanging low in the sky, rendering the view across the beach somewhat muted and gray. There are no immediate signs of precipitation, but patchy fog is expected to creep in overnight.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the forecast anticipates more clouds and the potential for fog in the morning hours, with temperatures inching slightly higher, peaking around the high 30s. The day remains obscured, with little promise of sunshine, and the gentle west-southwest breeze should offer a modest respite from the cold. With this winter weather upon us, it\u2019s advisable to layer up warmly, perhaps with a cozy jacket and a scarf, to ward off the chill while venturing outdoors. Ideal activities for this time might include indoor pursuits\u2014perhaps a leisurely visit to a local caf\u00e9 or a warm gathering with friends\u2014as the beach presents a stark, yet captivating, winter scene, best viewed from the comfort of a cozy spot away from the wind.",
