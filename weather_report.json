    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a frigid scene with a temperature hovering in the low teens, and while it feels bitterly cold with blustery winds whipping at over 40 miles per hour, the night sky remains clear. As we look ahead, expect a night characterized by mostly clear skies, albeit with temperatures dipping to around 1 degree, making it feel even colder with wind chill values plunging to about -8. Tomorrow brings a sense of brightness as mostly sunny skies are anticipated, warming slightly to the low 20s, though chilly wind chill remains a factor.\n\nGiven the harsh winter weather, outdoor activities may feel uninviting. The shoreline will likely reflect the cold air with some wave action, depending on the wind direction, which could lead to choppy waters. Appropriate attire would include heavy winter layers, hats, and gloves to withstand the biting cold. It's that time of year when the chill is typical for this region, with much of the landscape draped in winter's grasp. As we navigate through January, the invigorating cold can be a cue for cozy indoor gatherings rather than outside excursions, making it a good evening to find warmth indoors.",
