    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather presents a dreary picture, with light rain and a thick blanket of fog lingering over the area. The temperature sits in the low 50s, making it feel cool and damp, while a fierce wind from the south adds a biting chill to the air, stirring the waters of Lake Michigan into a restless state. As night falls, expect continued rain and areas of fog, with temperatures gradually climbing to the 40s overnight. The chance of precipitation remains high, and the forecast suggests up to a quarter-inch more rain.\n\nFor Saturday, cloudy skies persist, accompanied by a steady breeze, as temperatures hover in the upper 40s, making for a rather unpleasant outdoor experience. The waves on the lake are likely to remain choppy due to the ongoing winds, which could make any seaside activities somewhat challenging. Given the season, these temperatures are quite typical for late December in the Midwest, but the damp conditions feel particularly harsh. Attire should include warm layers and waterproof outerwear, ideally paired with sturdy footwear suitable for wet conditions. As for activities, outdoor ventures may be best postponed in favor of indoor plans, such as visiting a local museum or enjoying a cozy day with a good book by the fireplace. No notable holidays are occurring today, but the festive spirit remains palpable in the lead-up to New Year\u2019s celebrations.",
