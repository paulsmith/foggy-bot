    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois reveal a frigid landscape, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s and a forbidding atmosphere enhanced by a light freezing rain and snow mix along with persistent fog. The air feels biting and damp, as gusty winds sweep through, creating a rather bleak and chilling scene near the shores of Lake Michigan. The beach, usually a place of relaxation, is transformed into a winter tableau, its beauty muted by the shroud of snowflakes and frost. As night falls, the weather is expected to further deteriorate with snow likely until the early hours, followed by a grim mix of rain and snow, hinting at a messy overnight transition.\n\nTomorrow, snow will continue to fall, tapering off by late morning, but the cloud cover will remain thick and oppressive. With high temperatures barely reaching the mid-30s, the day will feel decidedly chilly, with strong north winds intensifying the cold and making any outdoor venture feel less inviting. Splashes of activity are best suited for indoors, where one can find warmth and comfort. If venturing outside is unavoidable, dressing in layers with a warm coat, gloves, and waterproof boots will be essential. As we approach the winter solstice, these bone-chilling, damp conditions are typical for this time of year in the Midwest, marking a distinctly wintry pattern that many in the region have learned to endure. With no holidays or special events on the horizon today, it might be best to cozy up and plan for indoor pursuits until the weather eases.",
