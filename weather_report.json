    "weather_report": "Evanston\u2019s current conditions present a chilly scenario, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s and a rather blustery wind sweeping from the northwest at around 40 mph, lending a truly wintry feel to the night. Light snow currently blankets the area, adding a soft layer to the skyline and creating a quiet, serene atmosphere, though the gusty winds may cause a bit of discomfort if one dares to venture outside. As evening settles in, the forecast offers a chance of scattered snow showers into the early hours, with lows dipping to the mid-20s. There\u2019s a slight possibility of new snow accumulation, though manageable.\n\nTomorrow promises a respite from the snow, presenting partly sunny skies and high temperatures barely reaching the upper 20s. The day will bring a breezy chill, suggesting that it may feel colder than the actual temperature. With wave conditions likely moderate due to the preceding gusts, outdoor adventure enthusiasts should tread carefully near the shoreline. Given the current season and the typical climate of the Midwest, these temperatures are consistent with February\u2019s usual cold spell, making warm layers and winter attire essential for any time spent outside. It would be best to bundle up in insulated coats, hats, and scarves, ensuring one is prepared for the brisk conditions. While not ideal for casual outdoor activities, the serene environment lends itself to quiet reflection or a brisk walk along the beach, embraced by the sounds of nature and the soft rustle of wind.",
