    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the current weather presents a chilly scene with temperatures lingering in the mid-20s, accompanied by a brisk, gusty wind that adds a biting edge to the air. Conditions are cloudy, wrapping the landscape in a gray veil as the night deepens, creating a somber yet tranquil atmosphere along the beach. As the early morning hours unfold, temperatures are expected to dip slightly before nudging upward to the high 20s overnight, with a shift to more blustery winds from the south-southwest.\n\nLooking ahead to Wednesday, a mix of clouds and the threat of scattered snow showers later in the afternoon moves into the forecast, bringing a 50% chance of precipitation. As temperatures peak near the high 30s early in the day, a notable drop to the low 30s is expected by afternoon, driven by strong gusts of wind that could reach up to 45 mph. The dare of possible flurries captures the winter vibe but promises little accumulation, leaving a brisk chill in the air. Given these conditions, bundling up in warm layers, including a good winter coat, hat, and gloves would be advisable for any outdoor ventures. This chill, typical for early December in this region, signifies the deep embrace of winter, heralding a season where outdoor activities shift toward the more reserved pleasures of cozy indoor gatherings or brisk strolls by the lake. \n\nHex Code:",
