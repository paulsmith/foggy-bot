    "weather_report": "This morning in Evanston, residents are greeted by temperatures in the low 40s, accompanied by a damp and chilly atmosphere. The wind is moderately brisk from the southwest, creating a bit of a chill that may interrupt your comfort as you step outside. While the clouds loom overhead, the forecast promises a shift towards mostly sunny conditions as the day progresses, with expected highs near the mid-40s. However, as evening approaches, expect scattered rain showers to sweep through the area, bringing moisture and a rather gloomy ambiance.\n\nAs the day unfolds, the wave conditions along Lake Michigan may be somewhat unsettled due to that blustery wind, making for a picturesque, yet potentially rough, view of the shoreline. Given the anticipated rain, a light jacket or umbrella is advisable for those venturing out. These temperatures are typical for late February in the Midwest, hinting at the lingering chill of winter, yet with tendencies towards slightly more pleasant days ahead. Despite the forecasted precipitation this evening, take advantage of the daylight by enjoying a brisk walk along the beach or a cozy afternoon at a local caf\u00e9 while the sun graces us with its presence.",
