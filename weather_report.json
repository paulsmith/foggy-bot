    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Evanston, temperatures hover in the low 30s, bringing a chilly bite to the morning air. The day is enveloped in a thick layer of clouds, creating a muted atmosphere, with a noticeable breeze whispering in from the northeast, creating an overall feeling of briskness. Throughout the day, a chance of snow looms, and the city may see a light dusting at times, with potential accumulation later in the evening. This wintry scenario brings not only a cold chill but also a sense of cozy anticipation for residents who enjoy the quieter side of winter.\n\nWaves along Lake Michigan are likely to be somewhat choppy, with winds picking up as the day progresses, gusting up to 20 mph. For those venturing outdoors, it's best to bundle up in warm layers, considering gloves and a hat essential to ward off the cold. Despite being chillier than average for mid-February\u2014when winter often wears thin\u2014the weather offers a quintessential seasonal landscape perfect for those looking to enjoy a brisk walk along the shore or perhaps a warm drink at a nearby caf\u00e9. As evening approaches, snow showers are likely to intensify, further transforming the landscape into a serene winter wonderland, making this day a lovely prelude to the weekend.",
