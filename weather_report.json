    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Evanston, the temperature hovers in the mid-40s, accompanied by a damp chill that seeps into the bones. With a gentle but noticeable breeze from the northwest, the air feels crisp but not unbearably cold. Cloud cover thickens, hinting at the scattered showers and potential thunderstorms expected overnight. As the clock ticks toward midnight, conditions may become a bit unsettled with rain likely, and a low temperature around the mid-30s, turning the atmosphere into a more somber scene, perfect only for those equipped for the elements.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, residents can expect a brief brake in rain, giving way to mostly sunny skies throughout the day. However, don't be fooled; temperatures will retreat into the upper 40s, cooling off noticeably by afternoon. Outdoor conditions will be accompanied by a breezy north wind, making for a somewhat brisk environment by Lake Michigan. Wave conditions may be choppy, given the gusts that could reach beyond 20 mph, so caution is advised for those near the shoreline. A warm jacket and perhaps a hat will be essential attire for anyone venturing outdoors, especially as we move into the last few days of winter\u2014a season that continues to display its unpredictability.",
