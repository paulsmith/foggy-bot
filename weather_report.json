    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly atmosphere with temperatures in the low 40s paired with a notably humid feel. The wind, gently brushing in from the south, adds a crisp note to the night, and the sky is mostly cloudy, casting a subdued light over everything. As we look ahead to Saturday, expect a gray day with highs inching towards the low 50s, gradually cooling to the upper 40s by afternoon. Gusty breezes are anticipated, reaching up to 15 miles per hour, making it feel even cooler. \n\nWith no immediate precipitation in sight, the beach appears calm but the waves may be gentle, perfect for a contemplative stroll rather than a vigorous swim. Given the conditions and the late autumn timeframe, it's advisable to dress warmly\u2014think layers, a cozy jacket, and perhaps a scarf. While there are no significant holidays today, the serene atmosphere could inspire a respectful reflection by the lakeshore. Exploring the local parks or enjoying a hot beverage at a nearby caf\u00e9 would fit beautifully with the day\u2019s cooler vibes.",
