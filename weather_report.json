    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a brisk and chilly atmosphere, with temperatures resting in the mid 30s. The air is filled with a noticeable bite from the east-southeast winds, which are howling at nearly 50 mph. Overhead, the sky looms heavy and gray under a shroud of clouds, creating a somewhat bleak ambiance along the shoreline of Lake Michigan. \n\nThis afternoon, expect persistent rain beginning around 3 PM, escalating to a certainty of widespread downpours later into the evening, with temperatures hovering near the low 40s. Rainfall amounts could reach between a quarter to half an inch, contributing to slippery conditions. With the day embracing a wintry feel, one might find it wise to bundle up in waterproof attire\u2014preferably a sturdy jacket along with boots to weather the elements. The current season aligns with typical Midwest winter weather, but the gusty winds and impending rain make it feel significantly more inhospitable. While outdoor activities may not be appealing under such conditions, one could enjoy indoor diversions, such as visiting local cafes or museums. Today also falls in the last stretch toward the quiet solace of the holiday season, where warmer moments indoors with friends might be the perfect antidote to the brisk chill outside.",
