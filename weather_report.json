    "weather_report": "As the sun sets over Evanston, the current temperature rests gently in the low 50s, accompanied by a subtle humidity that gives a cool and slightly damp feel to the air. With the wind rustling in from the west-southwest at a brisk pace, the atmosphere carries a hint of the unsettled weather to come. Tonight, expect scattered rain showers to grace the area between 7 PM and 4 AM, with the skies remaining predominantly cloudy. The temperature will dip to a low in the mid-30s, so those venturing out should prepare for the brisk evening with layers.\n\nTomorrow, the outlook is more cheerful, featuring mostly sunny skies and a high around the mid-40s, though temperatures will gradually retreat into the low 40s by afternoon. The day will likely reveal an invigorating quality, despite the chill. Wave activity on Lake Michigan may exhibit some height, making the shoreline a sight to see, yet not particularly inviting for swimming. Given the current season, these temperatures reflect typical late February conditions for the Chicagoland area, leaning towards the cool side but still within seasonal norms. As for attire, a warm jacket, perhaps a hat or gloves, is advisable for those planning outdoor activities, which could include a brisk walk along the beach or enjoying a warm drink in the park while watching the lake's restless waters.",
