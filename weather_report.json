    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather presents a crisp evening with temperatures in the mid to high 40s, wrapped in a partly cloudy sky. The atmosphere is pleasantly dry, making for a comfortable outdoor experience despite dipping into the low 30s overnight. As you gaze towards Lake Michigan, the night might seem serene, with the stillness underscored by the gentle rustle of leaves. However, a shift looms on the horizon as forecasted winds pick up from the west southwest at 10 to 15 mph, bringing cooler air into play for the coming day.\n\nTomorrow, anticipate a mostly sunny day with highs nearing 50, transitioning to a cooler afternoon. It\u2019s expected to remain mainly dry, with no significant precipitation in the forecast. Those hoping to enjoy the lakeshore may find it rewarding, though with the onset of brisk winds, layering is advisable\u2014think light jackets or sweaters to stave off the chill. For those determined to embrace the outdoors, a stroll along the beach or a visit to nearby parks could be delightful, especially as the daylight offers clarity and warmth. With the holiday season approaching, it's a perfect moment to enjoy the beauty of nature before winter fully sets in.",
