    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently experiencing a brisk evening, with temperatures settling in the low 50s and a gentle breeze that feels more pronounced near the shoreline. The skies are mostly cloudy, casting a muted light over Lake Michigan, which creates a somewhat somber yet tranquil atmosphere. As we look ahead, tonight's forecast hints at a slight chance of rain showers after midnight, accompanied by an increase in cloud cover and a low dipping into the upper 40s. Tomorrow brings a continuation of cloudy conditions with a slight chance of morning rain before giving way to mostly cloudy skies, as temperatures peak close to the low 60s.\n\nWhile the overall demeanor outside is on the chilly side, it may start to feel slightly damp later in the evening with the anticipated showers. As for the waves, conditions will likely be gentle, making it less than ideal for water sports but pleasant for a quiet stroll along the beach. Given the current cool and slightly drippy atmosphere, layering up would be wise\u2014consider a light jacket or sweater to fend off the chill. This time of year in the Midwest typically brings cool, crisp weather, so the current temperatures align well with the seasonal expectations. As this relaxed Friday evening unfolds, the beach may not be bustling, but it's a perfect opportunity for a reflective walk or some casual reading by the water under the watchful clouds.",
