    "weather_report": "Current weather conditions in Evanston, Illinois are marked by a damp chill, as temperatures hover in the mid-40s and a persistent light drizzle adds to the atmosphere of a gloomy, foggy morning. The wind from the southwest blows rather briskly, creating a rather brisk feel as it sweeps across the beach toward Lake Michigan. As the day unfolds, fog is expected to gradually dissipate, leaving behind cloudy skies with a high near 50 before temperatures take a dip in the afternoon, settling back to the low 40s. Occasional gusts may reach up to 30 mph, contributing to a raw, blustery feel throughout the day.\n\nWave conditions are likely moderate, with the overcast skies and drizzle making it less than ideal for beach activities. While the air has a decidedly wintry chill, it\u2019s advisable to dress warmly; a good layering strategy with a warm coat, perhaps a hat, and waterproof footwear would be prudent to combat the dampness. Given that we're in the heart of December, these temperatures are normal for this time of year, though they can feel more pronounced with the moisture in the air. For those considering outings, a cozy indoor activity or perhaps a brisk walk with appropriate attire would suit the conditions well today.",
