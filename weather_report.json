    "weather_report": "In Evanston this morning, the atmosphere is marked by the lingering effects of light rain, with a temperature settling into the mild mid-60s. The air is quite humid, adding a damp chill as the winds remain relatively calm. Looking ahead, the day brings the potential for more rain showers and the possibility of thunderstorms after noon, with overcast skies that promise little sunshine. Highs will hover around the upper 60s, though temperatures may dip slightly in the afternoon. Expect brisk gusts from the south, reaching up to 20 mph, which could stir the waves along the shore of Lake Michigan.\n\nThe beach presents an uninviting scene, with gray skies and rough waters indicative of the brewing storms. While precipitation is expected to increase throughout the afternoon and evening, bringing significant rainfall later on, the conditions may be too blustery for leisurely activities outdoors. Given the dampness, a waterproof jacket or umbrella would be wise attire, along with sturdy footwear to navigate any puddles. As we slide into autumn, these temperatures are typical for the season in this region, suggesting a shift toward deeper autumnal weather. Overall, for today, staying indoors may be the most prudent choice\u2014an excellent opportunity to engage in indoor activities like visiting a local cafe or enjoying some reading time at home, while you wait for clearer skies to return.",
