    "weather_report": "As we look out over Evanston today, the current conditions reveal a chilly but manageable day, with temperatures hovering in the low 50s. The air carries a crispness, enhanced by a notable breeze that, while brisk, contributes to a refreshing atmosphere near the lakeshore. Overhead, the sky is mostly cloudy, casting a muted light but providing no precipitation, keeping the day dry for outdoor activities. \n\nThis afternoon, expect much of the same, with temperatures gradually declining to the mid to upper 40s as the sun settles. The westward winds will continue at a steady pace, gusting prominently, which could make for a lively atmosphere by the water, given the added movement of the waves. As evening approaches and the temperatures dip closer to the low 30s, a warm jacket will be essential when heading out. Conditions are typical for a December in this region, encapsulating the essence of a crisp winter day. With no significant holidays around, outdoor enthusiasts might indulge in a peaceful winter walk along the shore or enjoy the beach from the comfort of a cozy caf\u00e9 with a warm drink in hand.",
