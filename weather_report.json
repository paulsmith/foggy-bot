    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly atmosphere, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s accompanied by a heavy feeling in the air. The day presents a cloudy canvas, setting the stage for anticipated snow flurries. As we look ahead, today\u2019s forecast indicates a 50% chance of additional snow accumulation nearing an inch, especially as winds from the north-northeast pick up to a gentle breeze later, possibly gusting to 20 mph. Tonight's outlook suggests a greater likelihood of snow, with expected accumulation of 1 to 2 inches, as the evening chill falls to around the upper 20s.\n\nGiven these conditions, attire should be warm and layered; think insulated jackets, sturdy footwear, and perhaps a hat to fend off the brisk wind. The beach along Lake Michigan might not be the ideal spot for a stroll, yet the snowy scene may offer a picturesque winter postcard appeal. With the landscape enhanced by the fresh snowfall, it invites a cozy day indoors or a brief venture outside for those embracing the wintry weather. As the calendar notes this day in mid-February, it aligns well with the typical seasonal chill expected in the Midwest, painting a seasonal story of resilience amid the cold.",
