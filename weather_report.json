    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the day is starting with a rather cool and damp ambiance, as a thick blanket of clouds looms overhead. Current temperatures sit in the low 50s, complemented by a brisk, gusty wind that adds a bite to the air. With gray skies dominating, the scene outside may feel a little gloomy, especially given the chance of intermittent drizzle throughout the day. Expect a high near 51, but don\u2019t be surprised as temperatures dip back into the mid 40s by the afternoon. \n\nAs the forecast unfolds, the likelihood of precipitation remains at 40%, with minor accumulation anticipated. Wave conditions along Lake Michigan may be stirred up by the wind, leading to choppy waters, perfect for observation but not ideal for swimming or other water activities. For those venturing outdoors, layering up is advisable; a warm coat, a scarf, and perhaps even a hat will help fend off the chill. While today's weather is typical for late November in this region\u2014characterized by cool temperatures and a decidedly wintry flair\u2014outdoor pursuits might be better suited to moments of brisk walking or enjoying the view from a cozy spot rather than extended time spent in the elements. As this is not a holiday, locals might simply enjoy a quiet weekend, perhaps gathering for a warm drink or cozying up indoors as the festive season approaches.",
