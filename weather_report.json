    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reflect a cool and slightly damp evening, with a temperature in the low 40s, making it feel brisk under mostly cloudy skies. A gentle breeze from the northwest adds a noticeable chill as night falls. As we look ahead to Wednesday, we can expect the day to start with the potential for light rain, tapering into scattered showers by midday. The high will be around the upper 40s, dropping into the low 40s by the afternoon, accompanied by a blustery wind that may gust up to 30 mph.\n\nGiven the conditions, the beach might not look inviting today, as the water will be choppy with wave conditions reflecting the winds. If you venture out, a light jacket and layers would be advisable to fend off the chill. This time of year in Evanston, temperatures typically hover in the low to mid-40s, aligning well with seasonal expectations. While not the most pleasant for outdoor activities at the lakefront, it could offer a tranquil opportunity for a brisk walk or a moment of reflection along the shore, especially as festive holidays draw near.",
