    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather presents a cool and somewhat unsettling afternoon, with temperatures in the low 60s and a noticeably humid feel in the air. The blustery winds are whipping from the southeast, creating a gloomy atmosphere reminiscent of a late autumn day. As the afternoon progresses, the sky remains dominated by thick clouds, and the likelihood of rain showers looms overhead, with a 70% chance of precipitation expected to unfold soon.\n\nThis evening is set to bring a dynamic shift, with a nearly guaranteed rainfall of up to three-quarters of an inch as showers give way to thunderstorms. The temperature will rise slightly overnight, settling in the low 60s, suggesting an oddly mild November night for the region. Wave conditions along Lake Michigan might be turbulent, making for choppy waters, which could be hazardous for small vessels. Given these conditions, individuals venturing outside should certainly consider donning a water-resistant jacket, along with sturdy shoes to navigate potentially slick terrain. As we approach a weekend without the immediate backdrop of any holidays, indoor activities would be more appealing, such as visiting local cafes or art galleries to escape the damp and windy weather.",
