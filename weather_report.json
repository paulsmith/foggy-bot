    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois present a chilly evening, with temperatures settling in the mid 30s and a mostly clear sky, creating an inviting ambiance for those who appreciate the crispness of winter. As the night unfolds, clouds will blanket the sky, leading to temperatures dipping to the low 30s and a gusty breeze from the north-northeast reaching up to 25 mph, with stronger gusts of 40 mph. This blustery arrangement is likely to create a biting chill, making for a somewhat uncomfortable outdoor experience unless properly bundled.\n\nLooking ahead to Saturday, expect the weather to offer a mix with only partial sunshine, as temperatures climb to near 35 during the day, accompanied by a gentle east wind. Waves on Lake Michigan may be slightly choppy given the forecasted winds, creating a classic winter scene along the shore. While there\u2019s no significant precipitation anticipated tonight or tomorrow, the blustery conditions may deter outdoor activity unless you\u2019re a fan of brisk walks along the shoreline or enjoying the beauty of a winter's day. Given the time of year, these temperatures are typical for late January in the Midwest, suggesting that residents should dress warmly\u2014layers, hats, and gloves are recommended for venturing outdoors.",
