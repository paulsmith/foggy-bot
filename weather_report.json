    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois present a brisk, wintry day, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s and a lively breeze stirring from the southwest. The air feels crisp and invigorating, with mostly cloudy skies casting a muted glow over the landscape. The wind is quite blustery today, making the chill just sharp enough to warrant some thoughtful layering.\n\nAs we look ahead to this afternoon, expect a brief moment of brightness as the clouds give way to mostly sunny skies, with temperatures peaking near the low 30s before gradually dipping to around 28. Tonight, the overcast will return, with a low temperature in the mid 20s and a steady, stronger wind developing in the evening, gusting up to 35 mph. Despite the chill, there is no precipitation in sight for today, allowing for clear enjoyment of the stunning Lake Michigan views.\n\nWith it being early December, these chilly conditions are quintessential for this time of year in the Midwest. Dress warmly in layers, including a hat and gloves, to stay comfortable if venturing outdoors. The beach may be too cold for swimming, but brisk walks along the shore could be invigorating. Birdwatchers might still catch glimpses of local wildlife, and for those who prefer indoor activities, cozy caf\u00e9 visits can round out the day perfectly.",
