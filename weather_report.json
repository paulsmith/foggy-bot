    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, current conditions paint a brisk winter scene with temperatures hovering in the mid 20s accompanied by blustery winds from the northwest. The air is filled with light snowflakes, creating a wintry atmosphere that\u2019s both chilly and invigorating. As the night progresses, the forecast indicates a chance of more snow showers alongside mostly cloudy skies, with lows dipping slightly into the low 20s. The wind will continue to play a prominent role, whipping at speeds around 15 miles per hour, with gusts reaching up to 25 miles per hour.\n\nFor Sunday, residents can anticipate a shift as the clouds begin to part, yielding partly sunny skies and a high near 30 degrees. Despite the slight warming trend, it would still feel cool, especially with the winds expected to calm to a gentle breeze. For those venturing outside, a warm coat, gloves, and a hat are essential attire to combat the chilly air, especially near the lake where the wind chill can be a factor. The winter season in this region can bring about temperatures like these, aligning with typical mid-February conditions. Those looking to enjoy the outdoors might consider a brisk walk at the beach or engaging with winter sports, all while being mindful of the prevailing wind and possible icy patches as the snow accumulates.",
