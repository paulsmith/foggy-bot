    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently experiencing a crisp and cool day with temperatures hovering in the low 20s, complemented by a gentle breeze coming from the northwest. The skies are mostly clear, creating a bright and inviting atmosphere, perfect for a stroll along the beach. As we look to the afternoon, expect sunny conditions with temperatures climbing to the upper 20s, though it will cool slightly in the later hours. The wind will shift to a calmer state but will still bring some gusts, making the chill feel a touch more pronounced, especially near the lakefront.\n\nWave activity appears moderate, which is typical for this time of year. As for precipitation, there\u2019s no rain or snow in sight, allowing for a pleasant outdoor experience. Given the cool air, it's advisable to dress warmly, perhaps with layers and a windbreaker, to fully enjoy the outdoors without discomfort. Considering the time of year, this weather is somewhat typical for early December in the Midwest. With no major holidays currently, it\u2019s a perfect opportunity to enjoy winter walks or visit local cafes.",
