    "weather_report": "This morning in Evanston, the air is brisk and biting, typical for this time of year. Current conditions include a temperature in the low 20s with a steady, gentle breeze from the northwest. The cloud cover hangs thick, giving the day a muted, grayish hue. Despite the chill, the forecast for today suggests a slight chance of snow flurries, making the air feel even more invigorating. As temperatures rise toward the upper 20s this afternoon, expect partly sunny breaks to offer fleeting warmth amid the coolness.\n\nThe waters of Lake Michigan are likely calm, providing a serene backdrop, though wave activity may pick up slightly with the gentle winds. As for attire, residents are advised to bundle up in layers and don warm accessories to ward off the cold. Given that December is fully upon us, today's temperatures align closely with seasonal expectations. Such chilly days are ideal for cozy indoor gatherings or perhaps a brisk walk along the lakefront to savor the crisp air and winter scenery.",
