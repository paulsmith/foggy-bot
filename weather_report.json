    "weather_report": "This morning in Evanston, the temperature hovers in the low 50s, accompanied by a dampness in the air that gives a distinctly chilly feel. The blustery winds sweep in from the west, contributing to a cloudy but relatively calm atmosphere over Lake Michigan, creating a scene that is at once soothing yet invigorating. As we move through the day, residents can expect mostly sunny skies with temperatures peaking around the mid-50s, before tapering off to the low 40s by evening. The northwest winds, which could gust up to 30 mph, will keep things fresh, and while tonight will bring mostly cloudy skies with a low near 42, the overall feel remains crisp rather than uncomfortable.\n\nThe current lake conditions appear to be moderate, with gentle waves reflecting the mixed weather; it is advisable for those headed out this afternoon to dress warmly in layers. A jacket, combined with a hat and perhaps a scarf, would be wise as the winds pick up. Seasonal temperatures remain typical for this time of year, as November in the Midwest ushers in cooler weather ideal for brisk walks along the shore or enjoying a quiet day outdoors. With Veterans Day celebrated today, families might enjoy a scenic outing, honoring the day with memories made by the water\u2019s edge.",
