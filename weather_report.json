The sky is predominantly overcast, casting a gray pall over the landscape, fitting for this time of year. As the evening unfolds, temperatures are anticipated to rise slightly, reaching the mid-20s, but the wind\u2019s fierce nature will keep conditions feeling notably brisk. Tomorrow, the weather will bring scattered snow showers beginning in the afternoon, though expectations keep snowfall amounts minimal. The day will start off cloudy, with wind gusts from the west-southwest amplifying the sensation of chill.\n\nGiven the current and upcoming conditions, one might find the appearance of the beach and its surroundings somewhat uninviting, enveloped in shadows and the darkness of night, reflected in the rough waves likely crashing against the shoreline. For those who venture outdoors, layering up with a warm coat, a hat, and scarves is advisable to stave off the cold. With the season transitioning fully into winter, these temperatures are fitting for December in the Midwest\u2014sharp, cutting, and true to form\u2014suggesting indoor activities may be more appealing than braving the elements. Engaging in seasonal traditions or visiting local holiday markets could be perfect ways to embrace this wintery evening.",
