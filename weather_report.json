    "weather_report": "A chilly afternoon in Evanston sees temperatures sitting squarely in the low 30s, accompanied by a dense layer of clouds that keep the sun at bay and create a somber, overcast ambiance. The strong, gusty winds from the north-northwest howl across Lake Michigan, whipping up waves that dance with a wild intensity. As the day progresses, snow is anticipated, with a 70% chance of flurries adding to the mix and potentially dusting the area with a light layer. By evening, the snow may taper off to scattered showers, with evening temperatures expected to dip into the upper teens, leading to a particularly brisk night.\n\nGiven the weather, those venturing outdoors should don warm layers, including insulated jackets, hats, and gloves, to stave off the cold. The wave conditions could make for an interesting, albeit frigid, view along the lakefront, making it a great time for a brisk walk, but best suited for a quick glimpse rather than extensive exploration. While today isn't marked by any significant holiday, residents will want to prepare for the wintry conditions that characterize this time of year in the Midwest, with temperatures aligning with the typical cold snap of late December as we approach the festive season.",
