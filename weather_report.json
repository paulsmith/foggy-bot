    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently experiencing chilly conditions with temperatures dipping into the mid 20s, accompanied by a gentle breeze. The sky overhead is cloaked in clouds, creating a rather subdued atmosphere typical for this time of year. The expected weather for tomorrow promises to bring a bit of excitement, as clouds reign continue to dominate, with a chance of light snow beginning in the afternoon. Highs will reach near the mid 30s, and south-southeast winds could gust up to 25 mph, enhancing the feeling of briskness.\n\nThe beach scene is likely to appear bleak and somewhat uninviting, with limited visibility and low temperatures creating a cold and stark landscape. While wave action may stir Lake Michigan slightly, conditions are not ideal for any water activities. Residents are advised to dress warmly\u2014layered clothing with a winter coat, hat, and gloves will be essential for comfortable outdoor exposure. This time of year, temperatures are typical for a Midwest winter, evoking the expected chill as we approach the holiday season. With no major holidays occurring today, the focus can remain on enjoying quiet moments indoors, but for the adventurous, a brisk walk on the beach might be invigorating, albeit cold.",
