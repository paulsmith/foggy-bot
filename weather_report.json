    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston are somewhat dreary, characterized by a chill in the air, with temperatures in the low 50s and a thick layer of mist enveloping the landscape. Wind gusts are howling from the northwest, creating a blustery and invigorating atmosphere as you gaze towards the calm waters of Lake Michigan, where gentle waves caress the shore. Unfortunately, visibility may be poor due to the fog, casting a muted light over the beach scene.\n\nAs we look ahead to this afternoon, the forecast suggests a continuation of cloudy skies with patchy drizzle and only a slight chance of rain. Highs will hover around the low 50s, likely dropping to the mid-40s later today. Tonight, conditions will remain mostly cloudy, with temperatures dipping into the upper 20s, making for a brisk evening. Given the season, these temperatures are typical for late November in the Midwest, but the dampness and wind could make it feel colder. For those planning to venture outdoors, layering up with a warm coat, gloves, and perhaps a hat would be wise to combat the chill. While it\u2019s not the most inviting day for outdoor activities, a brisk walk along the beach could be refreshing, though plans for a relaxed day at the park might be best reserved for clearer skies.",
