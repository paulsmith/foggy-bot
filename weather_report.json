    "weather_report": "The current weather in Evanston, Illinois, presents a chilly and overcast morning with temperatures hovering in the mid-20s. The brisk breeze from the east-southeast is quite pronounced, creating conditions that feel noticeably cooler. As you look toward Lake Michigan, the clouds gather, hinting at the precipitation expected later today. \n\nThe forecast promises a cloudy day with a high near the upper 30s, accompanied by a significant chance of rain and sleet beginning in the afternoon. Tonight, the temperature is set to rise slightly, with rain and patchy drizzle likely continuing. Wave conditions along the lake may become rough, with the gusty winds driving a choppy surface. It's advisable to wear a warm, waterproof coat and sturdy footwear if venturing outdoors, due to the impending rain and cool temperatures typical for December in this region. While the weather may not encourage outdoor activities, a cozy day indoors with a good book or a warm beverage may be the perfect alternative as we head closer to the holiday season.",
