    "weather_report": "As we settle into the evening in Evanston, the current conditions offer a crisp and cool atmosphere, with temperatures lingering in the mid 40s. The sky is mostly cloudy, casting a muted light across the landscape, while a fierce wind from the southwest adds a brisk edge, making it feel more invigorating than uncomfortably cold. Fortunately, precipitation is not anticipated tonight, providing a sense of calm as we transition into the early hours. \n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, Sunday brings mostly sunny skies, ideal for those seeking a respite from the indoor confines. Temperatures will rise to the low 50s before settling back into the mid 40s by afternoon, accompanied by a gentle breeze that should keep the air feeling fresh. It's a good time to break out light jackets and perhaps a cozy scarf, balancing comfort with the brightening scenery. As we embrace this wintry season, these temperatures are typical for early December, inviting outdoor enthusiasts to enjoy leisurely strolls along the beach or through local parks, possibly catching glimpses of the serene Lake Michigan.",
