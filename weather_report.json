    "weather_report": "The current weather in Evanston is distinctly chilly, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s and a brisk, howling wind enhancing the sensation of cold. Visibility is limited under thick cloud cover, creating a muted appearance throughout the landscape, particularly along Lake Michigan. The forecast for this afternoon signals potential freezing drizzle, transitioning to snow likely, which hints at a rather wintry scene ahead, matching the stark winter aesthetic of early February.\n\nLooking ahead, temperatures will stay around freezing, dipping further into the night with lows in the mid-20s. Expect sporadic chances of freezing drizzle and light snow before dawn, which may result in some slick spots. As for attire, layering is essential; a sturdy winter coat, gloves, and a warm hat are recommended to combat the biting chill. With the temperatures typical for this season in the Midwest, conditions may not be ideal for outdoor activities\u2014though a brisk walk along the beach could still offer a refreshing break, just be cautious of slippery surfaces. As we\u2019re deep into February, the season's cold grip continues to remind us that winter is far from over.",
