    "weather_report": "In Evanston this morning, temperatures are brisk, hovering in the low 15s with a blustery wind rushing in from the west. The air feels quite raw, as the wind brings an invigorating chill that may catch you off guard if you step outside\u2014be prepared for a wind chill that dips considerably lower. As the day advances, expect mostly sunny skies with temperatures rising to the high 20s but eventually back down to the mid-teens this evening, under clear and starry conditions. \n\nThe lack of precipitation today makes for a pleasant winter outing, though the gusty winds may create choppy conditions on Lake Michigan. While the waves might be riled up, it's best to avoid the shoreline if you're looking for calm and a leisurely stroll. Given the chilly atmosphere, dress warmly with layers, ensuring to include a thick jacket and a hat to fend off the cold. As we embrace this late November day, it\u2019s typical for the region, as winter slowly settles in, bringing short days and icy air. For those looking to enjoy the outdoors, a brisk walk or a brief visit to a nearby caf\u00e9 may prove delightful, though bundling up is essential to stay comfortable.",
