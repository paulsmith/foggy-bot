    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a stark winter chill, with temperatures lingering in the low single digits. The air feels sharply crisp, complemented by a biting wind that adds to the overall chilliness. Although the sky is clear, the day\u2019s openness does little to mitigate the severity of the cold, creating an environment that is not conducive to prolonged outdoor activities without proper attire. \n\nLooking ahead, the night will remain largely clear, dipping to around three degrees, while wind chill could plunge to a bone-chilling minus eleven. Tomorrow, a shift in conditions is anticipated, with a chance of snow arriving late in the afternoon, and the high near 27 offering only fleeting relief from the cold. Gusty winds will continue to create a wind chill that feels even colder, lending a sense of urgency to finding warmth indoors. While the beach may appear inviting in its stark winter beauty, wave conditions may present moderate activity given the winds, so those planning to enjoy the outdoors should dress warmly in layers, opting for insulated outerwear, hats, and gloves. Despite the dreariness of winter, it\u2019s worth noting that such cold is typical for February in this region, offering an opportunity for brisk walks or cozy gatherings rather than any prolonged outdoor enjoyment.",
