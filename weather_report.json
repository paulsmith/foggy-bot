    "weather_report": "As evening descends on Evanston, the weather presents a cool and slightly brisk atmosphere, currently marked by a temperature in the mid 50s with a gentle rise forecasted overnight. The sky remains mostly clear, allowing for glimpses of the stars, although clouds will likely roll in later tonight bringing a chance of light rain, particularly between 1 and 3 AM. As we move into tomorrow, expect a mix of rain before late morning, transitioning to scattered showers in a partially sunny afternoon, with highs around the upper 40s, a typical scenario for this time of year in the Midwest.\n\nThe beach scene tonight appears more somber and contemplative rather than inviting, with gusty winds adding a chill to the evening air, perfect for a serene stroll or quiet reflection by the shore. However, the rising waves may deter casual dips, particularly as conditions grow blustery overnight. With the potential for rain and cooling temperatures, it is advisable to dress in layers and keep an umbrella on hand for tomorrow. This time of year, with temperatures fluctuating between the low to mid 40s, reflects standard late fall weather, where outdoor activities may shift toward indoor pastimes or cozy gatherings as the holiday season approaches.",
