    "weather_report": "In Evanston tonight, the atmosphere is charged with the promise of rain, as showers and thunderstorms are expected to roll through the area between the early morning hours. The clouds loom heavily, suggesting that the night will be predominantly gray, with temperatures hovering in the low 60s and gradually rising. A brisk south-southwest wind, gusting up to 40 mph, adds a lively chill to the air, making it a rather turbulent evening along the lakeshore.\n\nFor Thursday, a similar narrative unfolds, with a high likelihood of more rain in the morning, tapering off to isolated showers by early afternoon. The temperatures will drop, painting a cooler picture as the day progresses. As precipitation is anticipated to accumulate between a quarter and half an inch, the beach may appear somber and uninviting, with gusty winds stirring up the surface of Lake Michigan, likely creating a rougher sea. As one considers stepping outside, layers will be essential; a sturdy jacket and perhaps an umbrella would be prudent to navigate the dampness. For those who prefer to stay dry, a cozy afternoon indoors, indulging in a good book or savoring a warm drink, might be the best course of action until the skies clear.",
