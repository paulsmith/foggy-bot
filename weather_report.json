    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the current conditions present a chilly atmosphere, with temperatures around the low 20s and a rather brisk breeze whipping in from the west at a fierce pace. The mostly clear skies allow for a beautiful view of the stars, though the wind chill creates a biting sensation that can feel as low as -2 degrees. As night unfolds, temperatures are projected to dip further to around the lower teens, making it advisable to bundle up before venturing outdoors.\n\nThe forecast for tomorrow promises a sunny day with highs reaching the upper 20s. As the day progresses, temperatures will start to fall again, accompanied by a gently breezy wind that may stir up a slight chill. With no precipitation expected, it's a great opportunity to enjoy the crisp winter air. Late autumn in this region typically brings such frigid conditions, so this weather is quite typical for this time of year. For outdoor activities, consider a brisk walk along the beach or in a nearby park\u2014just remember to wear layers to combat the cold and wind.",
