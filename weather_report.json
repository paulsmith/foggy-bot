    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston are rather brisk, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s and a veil of clouds overhead. The air feels noticeably cold, accompanied by a blustery wind that creates a biting chill as it whips across the landscape. The possibility of snow is on the horizon, with an 80% chance of accumulation overnight, hinting at a potential dusting for those waking up tomorrow. As the day unfolds, expect areas of fog to accompany a slight chance of rain or freezing rain, with temperatures rising to a high near the low to mid 40s.\n\nWith robust wave conditions likely due to the gusty winds, Lake Michigan may be churning, making it less than ideal for waterfront activities. The next few hours will not be particularly inviting for outdoor excursions; however, indoor activities\u2014perhaps a cozy caf\u00e9 visit or catching up on reading\u2014seem much more appealing under these chilly circumstances. As February unfolds, the temperatures align with the expected winter chill for this time of year, making warm layers and a sturdy coat essential for anyone venturing outside.",
