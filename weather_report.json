    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chill in the air, holding steady in the mid 40s with a blanket of clouds overhead, creating a dreary ambiance. The air feels overly damp, pulling the chill deeper into one's bones, while a gusty southwest breeze is stirring up quite a movement along the shoreline. As the morning progresses, there\u2019s a chance of light drizzle tapering off before dawn, with minimal accumulation expected, just enough to dampen the streets briefly but likely not enough to keep folks indoors.\n\nAs we look to Monday, the forecast offers a glimpse of brightness with partly sunny skies, though temperatures will only reach the high 40s, cooling off in the afternoon. It promises to be a quite brisk day, characterized by breezy conditions that will elevate the chill factor. For those keen on outdoor activities, a sturdy jacket is essential to ward off the cold, along with perhaps a knit cap, especially by the lake, where wave conditions may stir a bit in the presence of the wind. Though today isn't marked by any major holidays, it sets the stage for a quintessential mid-December day in the Midwest\u2014cool, cloudy, and inviting for a warm beverage and perhaps a peaceful stroll along the waterfront as nature transitions into winter.",
