The air carries a dampness that hints at possible patchy drizzle later on, reflecting the atmosphere\u2019s cool embrace. A gusty northerly wind, reaching up to 33 mph, adds a brisk edge to the day, making it feel even cooler as it sweeps across the open areas. \n\nAs we move into the day, expect continued cloudiness with temperatures peaking in the mid 40s before dipping slightly by afternoon. This will be a day that commands warm layers\u2014consider donning a sturdy jacket, perhaps a cozy scarf, and windproof gear if venturing outside. The lake may toss up some lively waves, though they are unlikely to swell too high, perfect for a bracing seaside stroll, provided one is suitably attired against the chill. While today isn't marked by any significant holiday, the pre-holiday spirit might inspire indoor gatherings, as Thanksgiving approaches in just two days.",
