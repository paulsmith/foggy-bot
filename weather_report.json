    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current conditions are marked by a biting chill, as temperatures rest firmly in the low teens. A brisk westerly breeze adds an extra layer of crispness to the air, contributing to wind chill values that make it feel even colder. The day appears mostly cloudy, casting a muted light that softens the landscape, with the beach and Lake Michigan offering a tranquil yet stark view. Fortunately, there are no signs of precipitation and the waves are relatively gentle, though they might churn slightly with the wind\u2019s steadiness.\n\nLooking ahead, tonight will bring a low in the single digits, ensuring that warmth is essential as temperatures dive further. As we move toward the evening, the sky is expected to clear somewhat, allowing for a glimpse of stars\u2014an invitation for those who bundle up to enjoy a stroll along the beach or a quiet moment by the water. Given these winter conditions, warm layers, gloves, and a sturdy hat will prove necessary to stay comfortable outside. As a reminder, December in this region often offers such brisk days, so today's weather aligns with typical seasonal expectations. For those feeling adventurous, the cool, invigorating air provides an excellent opportunity for brisk walks or perhaps even some winter photography to capture the serene beauty of the waterfront.",
