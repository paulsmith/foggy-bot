    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reflect a chilly atmosphere, with temperatures hovering in the low 40s under overcast skies. The brisk winds are quite fierce, reaching around 62 miles per hour, which adds a noticeable bite to the air. As evening approaches, the forecast predicts a transition to partly cloudy skies with temperatures dipping to around 27, complemented by a westward breeze that'll retain a gusty character. Tomorrow brings a shift to mostly sunny weather, with highs near the mid-40s, though temperatures are expected to decrease slightly by afternoon.\n\nWith the ongoing wind bringing a distinct coolness, a stroll along the lakefront would be invigorating but is best suited for those dressed warmly\u2014think layers, perhaps a sturdy jacket and a cozy hat. Wave conditions along Lake Michigan could be quite tumultuous due to today\u2019s winds, making it an unsuitable time for water-based activities. While it's not a holiday, the end of January typically feels stark and desolate for outdoor pursuits, but bundled visitors may still enjoy the winter's tranquility, if only for a brief venture outside.",
