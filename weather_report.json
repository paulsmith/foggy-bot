    "weather_report": "Evanston presents a chill in the air tonight, as temperatures hover in the low teens, perfectly capturing the essence of a crisp winter evening. The air feels brisk with a gentle wind whispering off Lake Michigan, suggesting a cozy indoor night is in order. Looking ahead to tomorrow, residents can expect partly sunny skies with temperatures climbing to the high 20s, a welcome change though still decidedly brisk. As for wave conditions, the lake appears calm tonight, foreshadowing a peaceful morning ideal for quiet reflection rather than vigorous aquatic activities. \n\nThough precipitation seems absent from the immediate forecast, the cold air invites the wrapping of warm layers: think insulated jackets and hats to stave off the winter chill. Given that today is a regular day in December, the festive season's approach brings a gentle excitement without the high stakes of holiday traffic. For those brave souls, a stroll along the beach might be invigorating, enjoying the peaceful solitude of winter's embrace as the lake\u2019s surface mirrors the moonlight. However, rest assured, for the faint-hearted, a warm beverage at home could be the much more appealing choice tonight.",
