    "weather_report": "Good morning from Evanston, where the day begins under cloudy skies with a chilly temperature hovering in the mid 30s, giving the air a crisp, brisk feeling for those stepping outside. Currently, a gentle breeze flows in from the south, contributing to an overall dampness as patchy fog has been lingering from the early hours. As the day unfolds, expect a gradual rise in warmth with the promise of partly sunny skies that could bring the temperature close to the upper 40s this afternoon.\n\nTonight, the clouds will prevail, and there's a likelihood of patchy drizzle and scattered rain showers following the late evening, with conditions remaining relatively mild for this time of year, as lows are predicted to hover around the upper 40s. With winds softening to a light southeast, expect a gentle rhythm to the waves along Lake Michigan, though they may grow slightly choppy with the onset of rain. As this Saturday falls well into late November, the season's chill is setting in, and today's temperatures are quite typical for the region. For those venturing outside, layering up in a warm jacket, perhaps with a water-resistant exterior, is advised to remain comfortable amid the potential for damp conditions. Take in the lovely views of the lake, but perhaps opt for indoor activities as the rain is likely to bring an end to leisurely strolls along the beachfront.",
