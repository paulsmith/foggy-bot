    "weather_report": "As the day unfolds in Evanston, current conditions paint a scene of chill with brisk winds stirring the air. At around mid-20s, the temperature feels crisp and cool, inviting a layer or two for warmth against a gentle yet noticeable breeze. Visibility remains fair, though the sky holds a blanket of clouds that bathes the area in a muted light, suggesting a classic winter day by Lake Michigan. Wave conditions are also active, as the gentle swells lap against the shore, creating a refreshing ambiance typical of this time of year. \n\nLooking ahead to the afternoon, a shift is anticipated as the sun makes a fleeting appearance, nudging temperatures to a high near the mid-20s before a gradual drop sets in. Evening plans should consider the forecasted dip to the upper teens, with overnight temperatures expected to rise slightly. This slight warming trend may provide a moment of relief, although bundled attire will be crucial as the day transitions into night. Typical of late December in this region, today's chill aligns with seasonal norms, crafting an ideal backdrop for wintery strolls along the beach, perhaps wrapped in a cozy scarf, or enjoying a warm beverage while soaking in the tranquil lakeside atmosphere.",
