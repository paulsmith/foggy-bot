    "weather_report": "As night blankets Evanston, the air feels cool and crisp with a temperature settling in the mid 40s, accompanied by a damp chill that hints at the approaching winter. Wind from the west is howling softly, carrying with it a clear atmosphere, free from any hint of precipitation. Looking ahead to the day, the overnight skies will remain clear, dipping to a low in the low 40s. As morning breaks, Friday promises sunshine, with temperatures reaching into the upper 50s, a comfortable warmth before retreating slightly in the afternoon. \n\nConditions at the beach are tranquil, though the currents may be brisk, ideal for a reflective stroll along the shoreline but not quite inviting enough for swimming. The vibrant colors of autumn foliage still hang on, making it a picturesque setting. For those venturing outside, layering is advisable, combining a light jacket with warmer attire for later in the day. This November weather feels typical for the season here in the Midwest, suggesting a perfect day for outdoor activities such as a leisurely walk or perhaps a visit to the local parks, enjoying the transition of the seasons.",
