    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a scene marked by light rain and a chill in the air, as temperatures hover in the low 40s accompanied by a brisk, howling wind that underscores the dampness. The atmosphere is thick and gray, cloud cover dominating the sky, creating a somber but poignant vista along Lake Michigan. Tonight, the forecast hints at a slight chance for lingering showers tapering off before midnight, with darkness settling upon the beach and gusts of wind expected to remain fierce, reaching up to 40 miles per hour.\n\nTomorrow offers a continuation of the chilly, overcast weather with temperatures reaching a high in the upper 40s before retreating in the afternoon. The inviting allure of a winterscape beckons, though the wave conditions are likely unruly given the robust winds and rain, making it less than ideal for boating or beach outings. Attire for the evening should lean toward warmth\u2014think layers, waterproof outerwear, and sturdy footwear to brave the bluster and damp. While it may not be the heart of summer, these temperatures are typical for late November along the lakeshore. As we edge closer to Thanksgiving, consider cozy indoor activities or a brisk walk to enjoy the seasonal change and preparation for the holiday festivities ahead.",
