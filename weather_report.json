    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly atmosphere with overcast skies, the temperature hovering in the mid-30s. For the evening, expect mostly cloudy skies, with temperatures dipping down to the low 20s but rising slightly overnight. The winds will be brisk, coming from the north, and could gust up to 30 mph, contributing to a biting chill. With no immediate precipitation forecasted, the visibility should remain adequate, though the cloud cover lends to a muted appearance around the lakefront. \n\nAs we head into tomorrow, conditions will offer a sliver of brightness with partly sunny skies; however, expect temperatures to only creep up into the upper 20s before some afternoon cooling sets in. The air will feel quite brisk, suitable for bundled-up layers, perhaps a warm coat and a cozy hat to fend off the chill. Given the season, these temperatures are typical for early February in the Midwest, where cold weather prevails but can often present opportunities for a soothing stroll along the beach or a brisk walk in the nearby parks. Notably, today is not a major holiday, allowing a serene winter evening to unfold, perfect for a quiet retreat or a leisurely evening at home.",
