A brisk south-southwest wind, gusting at times up to 35 mph, carries the distinct scent of the nearby Lake Michigan, providing a refreshing contrast to the humidity. The beach remains shrouded in a tranquil darkness, and although there is no fog visibly settling in, the atmosphere feels laden with moisture, hinting at a potentially hazy morning.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the promise of partly sunny skies unfolds as the day progresses\u2014a high near 78 degrees will invite those eager for the mildness of an autumn afternoon. With winds continuing at 20 to 25 mph, expect a refreshing breeze to dance across the shoreline, perhaps making it a little cooler as temperatures dip into the afternoon. This weather invites light layering; a comfortable long-sleeve shirt or a light sweater might be ideal for those planning strolls along the beach to appreciate the changing season. Casual outings could include a visit to local parks or coffee shops, where one can enjoy the seasonal flavors while watching the leaves cascade through the gently swaying trees.",
