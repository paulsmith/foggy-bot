    "weather_report": "Evanston greets the day shrouded in a thick blanket of clouds, where the remnants of rain linger faintly in the air. As the temperature hovers around a cool 66 degrees, it's expected to dip to 51 by afternoon, accompanied by gusty southwest winds that swirl through the city at speeds reaching up to 30 miles per hour, with occasional bursts even stronger. The chance of light rain persists before midday, casting a more somber and muted light over the beach and Lake Michigan beyond. \n\nThe waves appear a bit restless, nudged by the brisk winds, hinting at a rougher afternoon as the winds shift. Current conditions at the shoreline suggest a dampness in the air, though the rain has mostly steered clear for now. Those venturing out should consider layering\u2014a light jacket or windbreaker will help fend off the chill, especially as the sun remains hidden. While it might not be ideal for outdoor activities, a stroll along the waterfront could still provide a moment of reflection, wrapped in a cozy scarf, while the clouds drift above. This late-October day, seasonal indeed, invites a pause to savor warmth indoors, perhaps with a good book or a warm cup of tea, as the wind whistles through the trees along the beach.",
