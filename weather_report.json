    "weather_report": "The current scene in Evanston is marked by a brisk chill, with temperatures resting in the low 40s and a cloud-laden sky casting a muted light over the shoreline. The wind is howling, stirring up the air with a fierce intensity, creating an edge that penetrates through typical winter gear. As the evening unfolds, the forecast suggests a transition to partly cloudy skies tonight, leading to a low in the upper 20s, accompanied by a gusty west-northwest breeze that promises to dance playfully with any loose items left outdoors.\n\nLooking ahead to Tuesday, sun-breaks will emerge as the day progresses, with temperatures hovering around the high 30s but trending downwards in the afternoon. The conditions will likely offer a clear, albeit chilly day, ideal for brisk walks along the beach, though the wind will continue to deliver its vigorous touch. The waters of Lake Michigan may see choppy waves due to the relentless gusts; those considering a visit to the beach might find the air invigorating but should dress warmly in layers and prepare for the potential chill lingering near the water. This November day stands as a temporal reminder of the season, with temperatures reflective of typical late-fall conditions in the Midwest, offering a promising backdrop for seasonal activities as the Thanksgiving holiday approaches.",
