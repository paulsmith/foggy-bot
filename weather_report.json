    "weather_report": "Current weather conditions in Evanston, Illinois, paint a chilly picture. It's a cool low 40s night, with a noticeable breeze sweeping in from the northwest, creating a blustery atmosphere. Clouds blanket the sky, adding a layer of gloom that softens the edges of the urban landscape. Expect these gray clouds to linger into Saturday, with temperatures slowly inching toward the mid-40s, followed by an afternoon drop towards the low 40s. Though there are no precipitation threats in the immediate forecast, the gusty winds are likely to kick up waves on Lake Michigan, making for a restless lakefront scene.\n\nFor those contemplating outdoor activities, be sure to bundle up in warm layers, perhaps a heavy jacket and gloves, to combat the brisk winds and cool air. The November chill coupled with the seasonal cloud cover reflects typical Midwest weather, neither surprising nor particularly inviting for outdoor excursions. However, it could be a good opportunity for a cozy day indoors with warm beverages, or a brisk walk along the beach to enjoy the lingering fall atmosphere before winter fully sets in.",
