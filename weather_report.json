    "weather_report": "As the sun begins to dip below the horizon in Evanston, the current temperature hovers in the mid-50s, complemented by a refreshing, brisk air that carries a gentle humidity, making it feel quite comfortable for late fall. The skies remain mostly clear, with just a hint of clouds painting the scene, illuminated by the tranquil glow of evening. Winds are blowing from the northwest at a steady breeze, lending a gentle whisper to the air, though gusts can sometimes make their presence felt.\n\nTonight promises a delightful follow-up, with partly cloudy skies and a low settling into the mid-40s, creating an atmosphere perfect for a cozy night in or a leisurely stroll along the beach, should one seek the solace of nature. Tomorrow brings a continuation of this inviting weather; expect partly sunny conditions with daytime highs near 57, accompanied by a southeast breeze. The waves off Lake Michigan may be moderately active, providing a soothing soundtrack of gentle splashes, ideal for a calming beachside experience. As temperatures reflect typical November chill, be advised to dress warmly but comfortably, perhaps layering with a light jacket to accommodate the cool air in the evening. It's a fine time to enjoy a brisk walk, unwind on the beach, or embrace the serenity that this season offers before winter fully sets in.",
