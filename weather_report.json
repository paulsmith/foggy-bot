    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a chilly and brisk scenario, with temperatures hovering in the mid 20s and a notable gusty wind that gives the day an edge. As the afternoon unfolds, the weather is set to shift towards sunnier skies, yet the temperatures will gradually dip to around the low 30s, potentially leading to a chillier perception. Tonight promises a clear sky with temperatures falling to the low 20s, making for a rather crisp evening.\n\nAs for the Lake Michigan waves, they likely remain moderately elevated, given the ongoing gusty winds, which may create a rugged yet mesmerizing seaside view. There is no expectation of precipitation today, contributing to a pleasant atmosphere as the clouds give way to sunshine. With these conditions in mind, attire recommendations lean towards warm layers\u2014perhaps a cozy coat complemented by gloves and a scarf to ward off the evening chill. Situated in late February, these temperatures align closely with seasonal norms, so bundled-up outdoor activities such as brisk strolls along the beach or enjoying the waterfront from a warm caf\u00e9 would be ideal pursuits to embrace the wintry charm of Evanston.",
