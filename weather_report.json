    "weather_report": "Current weather conditions in Evanston are marked by a frigid chill, as temperatures hover in the low 30s, accompanied by a persistent light snow and a blanket of fog that casts a muted gray over the landscape. The wind is howling from the west at a brisk pace, creating a raw and biting sensation that underscores the early winter atmosphere. As we look forward to this afternoon, a mix of rain and snow is anticipated, with clouds thickening and temperatures inching slightly upward to near 42 degrees. Expect gusty winds that could whip through at 25 miles per hour, possibly leading to low visibility and slushy roads.\n\nThe beach, typically a bustling summertime haven, now presents a stark, chilly vista. With a light dusting of snow covering the sand, the waves are likely to remain gentle but could pick up slightly as coastal winds stir. Given the brisk and damp conditions, this is not an ideal day for outdoor activities; most would find it best to bundle up in warm, waterproof attire and perhaps seek indoor amusements. Dress warmly, perhaps layering with a sturdy coat, gloves, and a hat to ward off the cold. As we enter this notable time of year, Evanston shows us typical late November weather, reminding us that winter is undeniably approaching.",
