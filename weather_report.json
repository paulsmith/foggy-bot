    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the current conditions reveal a crisp and cool atmosphere, with temperatures hovering in the mid 30s and a gray, cloudy sky casting a solemn mood over the beach. As the afternoon progresses, rain is set to arrive after 3 PM, accompanied by a southeast breeze that will become noticeable at 15 mph, intermittently gusting up to 30 mph. The outlook for this evening suggests a steady rainfall before midnight, transitioning to drizzles and patchy fog overnight, raising temperatures slightly towards 39 degrees\u2014a damp and cloudy night ahead.\n\nWith the looming rain and the beach's wild, restless waves, the outlook is decidedly uninviting for outdoor activities. The combination of dampness and chill might make it wise to layer up, donning a waterproof jacket and sturdy footwear to navigate the wet elements comfortably. Given that we\u2019re well into December, these temperatures are typical for this time of year in the Midwest, marking the turn into winter. While it may not be the ideal day for a stroll by the lakeside, perhaps consider a cozy afternoon indoors with a warm drink instead.",
