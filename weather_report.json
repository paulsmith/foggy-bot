The sky is mostly clouded, hinting at what\u2019s to come\u2014a mix of showers and thunderstorms through the night. The winds whistle with authority, gusting up to 40 miles per hour, as the community braces for an 80% chance of precipitation, which could yield a quarter to half an inch of rain. The darkened beach, once lively with sunbathers and families, now lies quiet and ominous, the churning waves foreshadowing the unsettled weather that is to engulf the region.\n\nThursday will greet residents with lingering showers and thunderstorms in the morning, gradually giving way to pockets of sun peeking through the clouds by afternoon. Although high temperatures are expected to stabilize around 66 degrees before descending into the 50s, the air carries an undeniable chill, setting a tone for an unusual late October day. It would be wise to dress in layers, perhaps with a sturdy rain jacket and comfortable shoes, as the conditions may shift unexpectedly. While outdoor plans may be dampened, indoor visits to local cafes or bookstores can make for a cozy retreat, offering warmth and a respite from the brewing storm.",
