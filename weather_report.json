    "weather_report": "The current conditions in Evanston are decidedly chilly, with temperatures resting in the mid-20s, wrapped in a layer of cloud cover. The air feels crisp, buoyed by a vigorous, blustery wind sweeping in from the northwest. Tonight, expect partially clear skies as temperatures dip toward the low 20s, with a gentle breeze measuring 5 to 10 mph, offering a touch of relief against the cool evening air. \n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the forecast hints at potential snow later in the afternoon, with temperatures climbing to the mid-30s. The atmosphere will remain mostly cloudy, and winds are likely to shift to the south-southeast, bringing gusts that could reach 25 mph, so plan on a rather blustery day. Precipitation is quantified at 50%, suggesting a fair chance of flurries, though accumulations should be modest at under half an inch. Given this wintry scene, attendees might think twice about outdoor plans, favoring cozy indoor activities, especially with the holiday season approaching. Attire should prioritize warmth; layers, a good coat, and possibly a hat and gloves will be essential for comfort as Evanston continues to embrace the chill of winter.",
