    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois, present a chilly scene, with temperatures hovering in the low 20s and a brisk, howling wind creating a biting wind chill. The light snow currently falling adds to the wintery ambiance, though the visibility may be slightly obscured due to the flurries. As we look toward the afternoon, intermittent snow showers are expected, with a high near the upper 20s, contrasted by that strong gusty wind from the west, leading to a slightly overcast sky. Tonight, the clouds will clear up, bringing colder temperatures that could drop to around the mid-teens, making for an especially cold evening.\n\nGiven the blustery conditions and the current wintry landscape, dressing warmly is essential\u2014a good thermal layer, a heavy coat, and a scarf will be necessary to combat the cold feel. The lake appears relatively calm but with some small, rolling waves stirred by the winds, making it less than ideal for outdoor activities by the shore. Nonetheless, a stroll along the beach could be invigorating for those who love the crisp winter air, while cozy indoor pursuits might be more appealing for others. This time of year is typical for the region, with the onset of winter firmly establishing its presence, warranting preparations for the colder days ahead.",
