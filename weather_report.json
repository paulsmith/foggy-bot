    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois, present a distinctly chilly atmosphere, characterized by a temperature in the low 40s and a breezy chill that can be felt with a gusty wind sweeping in from the southeast. The day remains shrouded in cloud cover, with patchy fog contributing to a dim, moody landscape by Lake Michigan. With rain expected to intensify as the day progresses, the scene is likely to grow increasingly wet, suggesting an uninviting outdoor experience.\n\nThe forecast indicates a high near 47, meaning similar cool temperatures will persist throughout the day. As we move into tonight, expect continued rain and fog, with temperatures dipping slightly to around 45. The likelihood of precipitation remains high, accompanied by brisk winds that could create notable waves along the lakeshore. Given these conditions, dressing in layered, waterproof attire will be essential for comfort. The seasonal chill is typical for late December in this region, as we find ourselves squarely in the heart of winter. \n\nAs this is not a holiday, the day is ideal for cozy indoor activities\u2014perhaps visiting a local caf\u00e9 or exploring indoor exhibitions. The wave conditions may be rough, making it unsafe for any kind of water activity, while the persistent rain may deter outdoor endeavors. Be prepared to enjoy the indoors until the weather clears.",
