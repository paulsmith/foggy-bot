    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a crisp and cool atmosphere, with temperatures in the low 20s and a blustery wind sweeping from the west at a notable speed. The partly cloudy sky casts a muted light, creating a serene yet somewhat stark scene, particularly along the beach as it stretches towards the quiet waters of Lake Michigan. Tonight, expect a further drop in temperature, sinking to around the mid-teens, accompanied by a gentle west wind which may create a slightly chillier feel. \n\nLooking ahead to Friday, the forecast predicts mostly sunny skies with temperatures climbing to a pleasant high near the low 30s, making for an inviting day as the wind eases to a light breeze. As we embrace the early December season, this temperature trend remains typical for the region, although the wind adds an extra bite to the air. Given these conditions, it's advisable to bundle up in layers and consider a warm coat, gloves, and a hat if venturing outdoors. With the waves likely on the calmer side, it could be a pleasant opportunity for a brisk winter walk or a moment to enjoy the serene beauty of the lake, although activities might be limited after sunset, especially under these colder temperatures.",
