    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Evanston, the current temperature sits in the low teens, accompanied by a feel of crispness in the air that may bite at exposed skin. The humidity adds a touch of chill, causing a slight discomfort for those unaccustomed to winter's early embrace. The wind stirs gently, pushing through the atmosphere, adding to the coolness. The sky remains mostly clear, suggesting a visual treat as the sun rises over Lake Michigan, painting the horizon with hues of orange and pink.\n\nLooking ahead, today promises mostly sunny skies, with temperatures expected to rise to the high 20s, dipping slightly in the afternoon. A gentle breeze from the west-southwest will provide a refreshing touch, but not enough to disturb outdoor plans significantly. Tonight will bring partly cloudy skies, with a low in the mid-20s, ensuring that warmth is needed if venturing out after dark. The wave conditions are expected to be relatively calm along the lakefront, making for a pleasant view. With no precipitation in sight, it's a perfect day for brisk walks along the beach or enjoying the scenic views of the water, though bundling up is essential to stay comfortable. Given the seasonality, these temperatures are indeed nipping but within typical ranges for early December in the Midwest, reminding us of winter's steadfast arrival.",
