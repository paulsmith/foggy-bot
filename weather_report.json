    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reflect a crisp and cool atmosphere, with temperatures hovering in the low 20s and a gentle breeze whispering from the west-northwest. The skies are mostly clear, offering a tranquil view of Lake Michigan, though clouds will gradually make their way in overnight as a low of around 18 is expected. Tomorrow, prepare for a shift in conditions with a slight chance of snow showers, as an approaching system brings mostly cloudy skies. The anticipated high will reach near 30, cooling to around 27 in the afternoon, accompanied by a gentle to moderate wind.\n\nWhile the beach may radiate a stark beauty tonight, the presence of chilly air and the potential for snow tomorrow casts a somber tone, perhaps revealing an invitation to stay indoors with a warm beverage. The lake is calm, which may appeal to those looking for a serene walk along the shore, though it might feel decidedly brisk. It's advisable to dress warmly in layers to combat the seasonal chill, considering the typical winter weather for this time of year in the Midwest. While there aren't any significant holiday markers today, the seasonal atmosphere may prompt a cozy evening indoors, preparing for a busy holiday season ahead.",
