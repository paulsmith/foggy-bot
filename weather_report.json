    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a crisp and cool atmosphere, with temperatures hovering in the mid-20s and a layer of cloud cover adding to the wintry feel. The wind is howling at over 30 miles per hour, contributing to a biting chill that's typical for this time of year. Through the night, there\u2019s a chance of snow showers, with a low expected around the mid-20s. Tomorrow brings a similar scene, featuring cloudy skies and a likelihood of snow in the morning hours, with temperatures peaking in the low 30s before dipping again.\n\nWith this kind of weather, outdoor activities might feel less inviting, especially with the fierce winds sweeping across Lake Michigan. Observers can expect rough wave conditions along the shore, making it less than ideal for leisurely strolls on the beach. As for attire, layers are essential; a heavy coat, gloves, and a warm hat will provide comfort against the relentless chill. This cold snap is in line with typical February weather for this region, reminding us that winter still has its grip on the area. While no major holidays are around the corner, the next few days can still serve as a good time for cozy indoor pursuits.",
