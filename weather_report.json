    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Evanston, the weather carries a touch of autumnal chill. The morning is characterized by a mix of lingering clouds and scattered rain showers that are gradually dissipating as the clock moves toward midday. With temperatures peaking near a brisk 66 degrees earlier, the air is set to cool to around 51 degrees by afternoon, ushering in a stark sense of the season. A robust southwest wind whips through the area, with gusts soaring up to 50 mph, adding an energetic bite to the atmosphere. Today, there\u2019s a 70% chance of precipitation, hinting at the remnants of rainfall lingering on the horizon.\n\nThis evening promises partly cloudy skies and a drop to near 40 degrees, encouraging residents to reach for warm layers and jackets if venturing outdoors. The waves on Lake Michigan, while calm for now, could become restless with the wind's force. Those planning to stroll along the beach should prepare for cooler conditions and the occasional gust that stirs the surface of the lake. For the more adventurous, an afternoon exploration through one of the local parks could be invigorating, allowing one to appreciate the vibrant hues of fall foliage against a dreary sky, while others might find solace in a cozy caf\u00e9, watching the world swirl by through fogged windows.",
