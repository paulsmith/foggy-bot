    "weather_report": "Evanston wakes up to a brisk, chilly morning with temperatures hovering in the mid-single digits, paired with a stiff breeze that makes the air feel even colder. Currently, the sky is mostly cloudy, providing a rather muted palette over Lake Michigan, though the clouds seem to be breaking slightly to allow some light through. The wave conditions are moderate, with waters reflecting the gray sky; while there isn't a threat of precipitation today, the conditions demand a hearty winter coat, gloves, and perhaps a scarf for those venturing outdoors.\n\nAs we look ahead to today's weather, expect a shift towards partly sunny skies with a high nearing the mid-teens as the day progresses. Winds should remain gentle and relatively calm this afternoon, easing slightly from their current gusty state, which means a more comfortable experience, though the wind chill will linger to remind us of winter's grip. Evening plans can proceed under clear stars, though temperatures will dip to the low teens overnight. Given the winter season, these conditions are typical for this time of year, making for a quintessential Chicago winter day. Ideal activities include bundled-up strolls along the beach, perhaps some hot cocoa at a nearby caf\u00e9, or simply enjoying the tranquility that comes with a winter afternoon by the lake.",
