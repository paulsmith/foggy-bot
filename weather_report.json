    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current scene is defined by a brisk chill with temperatures in the upper 40s. The inviting tableau of partly cloudy skies juxtaposes the soothing movement of Lake Michigan, where gentle waves lap at the shore. Humidity settles around a comfortable level, adding a touch of crispness to the air that makes a brisk walk delightfully refreshing. As the afternoon progresses, expect mostly sunny conditions and temperatures to edge slightly higher, while light breezes from the east southeast add a gentle touch.\n\nTonight, the temperature will dip into the low 40s, inviting a cozy evening indoors or a layered stroll along the waterfront. Wave conditions remain moderate, making it a serene day for viewing the lake, although one should keep in mind the cooler temperatures. With no precipitation on the horizon, today is ripe for outdoor activities, whether it\u2019s a visit to the beach or enjoying a warm drink at a local caf\u00e9. Consider wearing layers to adapt to the cooling evening that is typical for a mid-November day in the region. This time of year generally sees chilly climes in the Midwest, making today's temperatures a fitting reflection of the season.",
