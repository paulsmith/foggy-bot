    "weather_report": "Evening in Evanston presents a gray and drizzly scene, with current temperatures in the low 50s complemented by a touch of humidity that makes the air feel damp and chilly. The winds are fierce, howling from the southeast, creating a blustery atmosphere along Lake Michigan. Light rain falls steadily, setting a somber tone as clouds loom overhead, obscuring any hint of evening cheer. This weather will carry on into the night, with projections suggesting a continued downpour\u2014expect temperatures to rise slightly as the night wears on, reaching around the low 50s in the early hours.\n\nLooking ahead to Thursday, rain is likely to persist until mid-afternoon, with a high expected to linger in the mid-50s. The clouds will remain dominant, and the chance of additional rain adds a layer of gloom to the day\u2019s activities. With gusty winds expected, outdoor plans might be best postponed, as the conditions are less than inviting. As we are well into autumn, this weather feels typical for the season, aligning with the cooler temperatures of the Great Lakes region. For those venturing out, sturdy rain gear and warm layers will be essential to stay dry and comfortable amidst the damp chill. It\u2019s a good evening for indoor activities, perhaps enjoying a cozy meal or diving into a good book while the rain patters against the windows.",
