    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston paint a rather gloomy picture, with dense fog hanging over the shoreline and a temperature hovering in the low 50s. The atmosphere feels quite soupy and damp, a stark contrast to what one might expect for mid-November. As the day progresses, expect rain showers to move in after 11 a.m., heralded by a brisk, southeast breeze that will stir up a fair bit of activity, with wind gusts approaching 30 mph. The chance for precipitation stands at a hefty 90%, with rainfall totals potentially reaching half an inch by this evening.\n\nThe day is likely to remain overcast and damp, with temperatures rising to the high 50s before settling back to around 56 overnight, creating a rather uncomfortable and sticky environment. With such high winds and rough waters anticipated on Lake Michigan, wave conditions could be choppy, impacting any waterfront activities. Given the drizzling forecast and the weighty clouds looming overhead, it may be wise to don a waterproof jacket and sturdy shoes if venturing outdoors. This day does not coincide with any major holiday, so local outings may be muted. Instead of beach fun, a warm caf\u00e9 or indoor event would be much more inviting in today's dull and drizzly conditions.",
