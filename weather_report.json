    "weather_report": "Evanston wakes to a chilly night, with the temperature resting in the low 40s, accompanied by a damp chill that makes for a brisk evening air. The atmosphere is rather still, yet the winds are beginning to whisper from the southeast, hinting at the change ahead. Mostly cloudy skies offer little clarity, leaving the night draped in a muted gray, while waves on Lake Michigan may be a bit tumultuous due to the gusts reaching higher speeds late into the evening.\n\nAs the day unfolds, residents can expect more of the same cloudiness, with temperatures climbing towards the mid-50s by afternoon. There's a slim chance\u2014only about 20%\u2014of encountering some rain after 3 PM, but for now, the precipitation remains absent. Given the season, today's temperatures are fairly typical for mid-November in Illinois, though one can expect a slightly damp and cool sensation that veers toward the unpleasant side for some. Attire suggestions would favor warmth: light layers, perhaps a windbreaker, accompanied by a scarf and comfortable shoes. As the day progresses, outdoor activities may be best enjoyed in short bursts,, possibly taking in a brisk walk along the lakefront, mindful of potential rain later.",
