    "weather_report": "In Evanston, current conditions present a brisk and damp backdrop with temperatures hovering in the mid to high 30s. The air carries a chilly edge as a blustery northwest wind whispers in at nearly 25 miles per hour, creating a raw atmosphere perfect for curling up indoors. The sky is partly cloudy, adding a hint of light to the evening, yet the forthcoming forecast hints at a slightly more turbulent night, with a 20% chance of light rain before giving way to patchy drizzle. As the temperature drops to the low 40s, it combines with these breezy winds, suggesting a less than inviting environment for outdoor activities.\n\nLooking ahead to Friday, clouds will dominate the skyline, with high temperatures lingering in the upper 40s before dipping down in the afternoon. The persistent winds will maintain their lively presence, gusting upwards of 30 miles per hour. In terms of wave conditions, expect a bit of movement on Lake Michigan with increased activity due to the winds, though specifics on wave height remain unverified without local reports. Layered attire would be prudent for anyone venturing outside, perhaps opting for a warm coat, a scarf, and sturdy footwear. While these conditions may not align with typical outdoor recreational pursuits, those bundled up might still find enjoyment in brisk walks along familiar paths, relishing the quiet beauty of the season in this charming lakeside locale as the holiday season approaches.",
