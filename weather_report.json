    "weather_report": "Evanston is experiencing a chilly evening under a blanket of clouds, with the temperature hovering in the mid-20s. The air is brisk, stirring with a fierce wind that adds a biting edge to the atmosphere, making for an uncomfortably crisp experience outdoors. Tonight, expect a low around the mid-20s, with winds continuing to swirl from the south-southwest, gusting up to 35 mph. Despite the overcast skies, the evening remains calm in terms of precipitation, with no significant rain or snow on the horizon.\n\nAs we look ahead, tomorrow promises a brief reprieve with partly sunny skies, reaching a high near the low 30s during the day. This change in the weather will bring a slightly more pleasant outlook, but the wind will still hold a strong presence, challenging anyone tempted to venture outside. Given the current season, these temperatures are fairly typical for early December in the region. As for attire, layering up with a warm coat, hat, and scarf is advisable to fend off the sharp wind chill. Despite the coolness, outdoor activities can remain enjoyable with the proper gear, particularly for those who might take a brisk walk along the beach or visit local parks, keeping in mind that daylight is fading fast.",
