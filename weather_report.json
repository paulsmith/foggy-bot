    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly scene, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s, lending a crisp texture to the air. The daylight fades into mostly cloudy skies, casting a muted light over the shoreline at Lake Michigan. Blustery winds whip through the area at an energetic pace, an invigorating reminder of winter's approach. There appears to be no precipitation, offering a clear opportunity for outdoor enjoyment, albeit bundled up against the cold.\n\nAs we transition into the evening, expect temperatures to dip into the mid-20s, maintaining breezy conditions as the wind sways but seems to carry away any lingering moisture. Though today's weather is typical for early December in this part of the Midwest, the scene offers a beautiful, albeit brisk, backdrop for activities like a walk along the beach or a visit to nearby parks, perfect for savoring the seasonal chill. Don your warmest layers, and consider a hat and gloves if venturing outside, as the atmosphere invites for a brisk yet pleasant winter outing.",
