    "weather_report": "Today in Evanston, the atmosphere carries a certain bracing chill as temperatures hover in the low 50s, embraced by mild humidity that gives a slightly damp feel to the air. The scene is mostly overcast, casting a muted light over the landscape, and a gentle breeze stirs the surface of Lake Michigan, providing a hint of autumn\u2019s persistence. As we move through the afternoon, expect temperatures to rise just a few degrees, peaking near 56. However, the winds will shift, becoming a bit blustery from the southeast, with gusts adding a touch of bite as they swirl around.\n\nAs evening approaches, the clouds will thicken, heralding the onset of rain showers after 7 PM. The likelihood of precipitation stands at a solid 80%, so preparations for wet weather are a must if you plan to be outside. With temperatures dipping to the low 50s tonight, a light jacket and an umbrella will be wise companions for anyone venturing out. Given that we\u2019re in mid-November, these conditions reflect the typical crispness of the season, though with a tinge of humidity that might linger in the air. For those considering outdoor activities, a stroll along the beach could be refreshing but best done earlier in the day. Later, cozy indoor pursuits will provide a warmer alternative as the rain sets in.",
