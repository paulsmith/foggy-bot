    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reflect a chilly evening, with temperatures in the mid-20s, accompanied by a gusty wind that adds a sharp bite. The day is closing out with a blanket of clouds shrouding the sky and intermittent snow showers expected as we move deeper into the night. The waves on Lake Michigan are likely to be wild, stirred by the bluster, creating a dramatic seascape devoid of the calm tranquility often sought on clear days. As the temperatures are typical for this time of year, the air carries a crispness that hints at the full grip of winter, but not an unwelcoming one, just a reminder of the season\u2019s presence.\n\nAs we prepare for tonight, residents should layer up, opting for warm jackets and perhaps a cozy hat to fend off the chill, especially with temperatures expected to dip further into the low 20s by morning. While outdoor activities may be limited given the weather\u2014maybe a brisk walk along the lake or enjoying the snowy landscape\u2014inside is where warmth and holiday cheer could take center stage. With Thanksgiving just past, the atmosphere might still echo with familial warmth and gratitude. Embrace the evening, whether indoors, with a mug of something warm, or by catching the sights of winter\u2019s first snowflakes dancing in the gusty breeze.",
