    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston are marked by a chilly atmosphere, with temperatures lingering in the mid-30s and a brisk, gusty wind sweeping through at nearly 50 miles per hour. This combination creates a decidedly brisk feel, typical for late November along Lake Michigan. The skies above are partly cloudy, adding to the crispness of the evening, though no precipitation is expected through the night. \n\nAs we look ahead to tomorrow, a shift to sunny skies is anticipated, with highs reaching near 40 degrees but gradually cooling to the upper 30s by afternoon. The west wind will moderate, blowing gently at 10 to 15 miles per hour. Given these conditions, layering up will be essential; a warm coat, gloves, and a hat are advisable for anyone venturing outdoors. The wave conditions at the beach will likely reflect the gusty winds, producing choppy waters, which may deter casual strolls along the shore. This time of year usually brings cool and frosty conditions, and while this chill is typical for the Midwest in late fall, enjoying brisk walks or perhaps a quick visit to nearby cafes can make for a pleasant day. As there are no holidays falling today, the tranquility of a winter's evening remains undisturbed, inviting a moment of reflection before the busyness of the upcoming holiday season.",
