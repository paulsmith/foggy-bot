    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current scene is a brisk one, where the temperature hovers in the low 50s, embraced by a feeling of coolness that cuts through the air. The sky is mostly clear, yet the presence of a powerful breeze\u2014whipping at about 75 miles per hour\u2014adds an invigorating edge to the day. As the afternoon unfolds, expect scattered rain showers to creep in, with clouds rolling over the beach landscape while temperatures drop towards the high 40s. This could lead to a transition into snow as the sun sets, with the mercury dipping into the low 30s later tonight.\n\nGiven the gusty conditions and potential for precipitation, it's best to dress warmly in layers\u2014think insulated jackets, hats, and gloves to combat the chill. The combination of wind and falling temperatures makes outdoor ventures somewhat precarious, especially given the strong waves that may be present on Lake Michigan, making beach walks less inviting. With Thanksgiving just days away, consider cozy indoor activities or planning a visit to a local caf\u00e9 for a warm drink. Such a day, while bracing, beckons a reflective moment by the water, as nature shifts from autumn into the stark quietude of winter.",
