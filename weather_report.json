    "weather_report": "As the afternoon sun casts a muted glow over Evanston, current conditions reveal a crisp, cool atmosphere characterized by cloud cover and a gentle breeze from the north-northeast. The temperature hovers in the low 20s, offering a genuinely wintry feel, while the brisk winds create a sharp edge to the chill. The waves on Lake Michigan are moderately agitated, reflecting the gusty winds, which may reach near 15 mph, adding a touch of drama to the lakefront scenery.\n\nLooking ahead, the forecast calls for continued cloudiness, with temperatures peaking in the upper 20s before eventually dipping again. There's a 50% chance of snow tonight, as lows settle around the mid-20s, with the possibility of light snow accumulation adding a dusting to the landscape. This combination of elements suggests a less-than-pleasant outdoor experience, especially as evening approaches. For those venturing outside, warm attire is advisable to combat the cool and somewhat windy conditions. Given the time of year, these temperatures are entirely typical for early January in the Midwest, inviting a variety of winter activities. Despite the chill, one might still enjoy a brisk walk along the beach or partake in a cozy indoor gathering, while the prospect of snow could spark interest in classic winter pastimes in the days ahead.",
