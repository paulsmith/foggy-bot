    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather is decidedly brisk, with temperatures lingering in the low single digits. The air carries a biting chill, accentuated by a fierce wind creating bone-numbing wind chill values. As the afternoon unfolds, the forecast calls for mostly cloudy skies with a slight rise in temperature, peeking around 11 degrees before settling back to near 8. The blustery winds from the west-northwest will continue to howl, making it feel considerably colder, with wind chills plummeting as low as -10.\n\nLater tonight, expect partly cloudy conditions with temperatures dipping to around 0, accompanied by a stark chill making it feel closer to -17. With wave conditions potentially driven by the strong winds sweeping across Lake Michigan, the overall atmosphere remains quite unpleasant for outdoor activities. For those venturing outside, layering up in heavy winter attire, complete with hats, gloves, and scarves, is strongly recommended to combat the bitter cold. Given that it\u2019s mid-February, this weather is typical for the season in this region. While it's not a day for leisurely walks on the beach, festive indoor activities might offer solace against the wintry elements.",
