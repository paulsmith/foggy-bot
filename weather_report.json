    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently experiencing cool and cloudy conditions with the temperature sitting in the low 50s, accompanied by a slightly humid ambiance that makes it feel brisk. A gentle northwesterly breeze adds to the chill, creating an atmosphere that is fitting for a late autumn day. As the afternoon progresses, temperatures will peak near the mid 50s before gently retreating later in the day. Expect similarly overcast skies tonight, with a drop to the mid 40s, underlining the season's transition.\n\nThe lake remains calm, ideal for quiet reflections rather than exhilarating activities, as wave conditions are mild with little to no wind ripples on the water's surface. Fortunately, there appears to be no precipitation expected, which allows for outdoor activities, though the cool temperatures urge some caution against the bite of the wind. With low temperatures typical for this time of year in northeastern Illinois, a light jacket along with long sleeves is advisable for anyone heading outside. The day may not lend itself to sunbathing, but a stroll along the beach or a visit to the parks could be quite pleasant for those equipped with the right attire. This day is an ordinary one for late November, with no major holiday on the horizon, presenting a perfect opportunity to enjoy the quieter beauty of Lake Michigan.",
