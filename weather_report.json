    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a cold and dreary atmosphere, with temperatures lingering in the low 30s and a damp chill that feels persistent in the air. The fog and mist hovering over the beach contribute to a shadowy landscape, where visibility may be limited. Winds are brisk, coming from the north-northwest at a fierce pace, adding an edge to the already biting temperatures. The scenery along the lake is transformed into a wintry backdrop, as snow begins to sprinkle down, setting the stage for more accumulation overnight.\n\nLooking ahead, expect snowfall throughout the day, with the temperature peaking in the mid 30s before falling slightly in the afternoon. The gusty winds will continue, likely making conditions feel even more wintery, while a complete cloud cover adds to the somber tone. With a 100% chance of snow and potential for accumulations of an inch or more, it\u2019s wise to prepare for slippery and wet conditions if venturing out. As such, layers of warm clothing, waterproof outerwear, and sturdy footwear are recommended for anyone stepping outside to weather these conditions. Considering the season and location, temperatures are in line with what one would expect for mid-December in the Midwest, where winter holds sway.\n\nGiven the forecast and prevailing conditions, indoor activities might be best, such as visiting a local cafe or exploring community events that embrace the cozy spirit of the season. It is indeed a day to enjoy the comfort of warmth indoors, especially with the holidays approaching.",
