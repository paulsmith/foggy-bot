    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly atmosphere with temperatures hovering in the mid-20s, presenting a crisp and cool feel, perfect for bundling up. As the evening progresses, residents can expect occasional snow showers transitioning into more scattered flurries, with temperatures dipping to around the low teens. Winds are predicted to pick up considerably, becoming quite gusty, and wind chill values may fall to about -5, making it advisable to wrap up warmly. \n\nLooking ahead, Thursday morning will bring occasional snow before the sun breaks through, leading to slightly brighter conditions by afternoon. Despite the onset of winter weather, daytime temperatures will remain in the high 20s, which is typical for early December in this region. The brisk winds may create rough wave conditions along Lake Michigan, making any beach visits feel frigid. For those brave enough to venture outdoors tonight or during the day tomorrow, layered clothing, including warm hats and gloves, is highly recommended. Given the evolving weather, cozy indoor activities may be a better choice for this December evening.",
