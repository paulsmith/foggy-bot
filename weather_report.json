    "weather_report": "Today in Evanston, the temperature sits in the low 50s, accompanied by a crisp and refreshing humidity that enhances the sensation of autumn in the air. A brisk wind is stirring from the northwest, creating a gentle dance upon Lake Michigan's surface. The sky is mostly clear, allowing the sun to break through the clouds, promising a sunny afternoon that will bring temperatures to near the upper 50s before they settle back into the low 40s overnight. With such clarity, it appears the day will remain precipitation-free, making it a pleasant outing as the season transitions toward the chill of winter.\n\nGiven these inviting conditions, it\u2019s wise to dress in layers\u2014perhaps a light jacket to fend off the morning chill and a cozy sweater for the potential drop in temperature later. The lake's waves, moderately stirred yet manageable, suggest ideal conditions for a serene stroll along the beach or a brief visit to one of the nearby parks. There's no major holiday today, but it\u2019s a fine day for some outdoor activity, whether it's a leisurely walk by the water or a chance to enjoy nature's beauty amidst the changing leaves.",
