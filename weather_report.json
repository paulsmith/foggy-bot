    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Evanston, the weather brings a crisp chill with temperatures hovering in the upper 20s. The air feels distinctly invigorating, complemented by a gusty breeze sweeping in from the west-southwest. Clouds linger overhead, creating a mostly cloudy sky that adds a subtle gray hue to the landscape but allows for snippets of sunshine to break through intermittently. The wind\u2019s spirited dance across Lake Michigan raises the water into gentle yet animated waves, perfect for those who appreciate the invigorating sound and sight of nature at play.\n\nLooking ahead, the atmosphere will remain fairly stable, with temperatures expected to inch slightly higher this afternoon, reaching near 31, before settling back down to about 26 tonight. With the winds becoming more gentle, creating a less blustery feel, the evening offers a more serene opportunity for an evening stroll along the shore if you\u2019re bundled adequately against the cool air. No precipitation is anticipated, making this a favorable day for outdoor activities, be it a walk on the beach, enjoying the fresh air, or just gazing at the picturesque lakefront scenery. As we embrace early December, these temperatures are typical for this season, wrapping us in the familiar chill of winter while ushering in the holiday spirit with the sights and sounds of the shoreline.",
