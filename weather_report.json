    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois reveal a crisp and cool atmosphere with temperatures lingering in the low 50s, accompanied by a gentle breeze coming from the south. The beach vista toward Lake Michigan presents a tranquil scene; however, the day is expected to transition into a more overcast evening with areas of drizzle anticipated after 8 PM. As temperatures drop to the mid 40s tonight, the pleasant appearance of the afternoon will give way to a murky evening.\n\nThe waves should be relatively calm given the wind conditions, but with gusts potentially reaching 20 mph later today, they could pick up slightly, making conditions variable. With a slight chance of precipitation on the horizon, it\u2019s advisable to keep an umbrella handy for this evening. Given the current season, the mild temperatures are quite typical for early December, though the coolness may prompt individuals to bundle up in layers. Comfortable attire, such as a light jacket and closed shoes, would be ideal for anyone venturing outside today or into the evening. With the current weather, a stroll along the beach or a visit to local caf\u00e9s would certainly make for enjoyable activities, allowing for a cozy embrace of the early winter atmosphere.",
