    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current atmosphere is quite brisk, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s and a moist chill in the air. The conditions are marked by a blustery northwest wind, stirring up the surroundings and imparting a distinctly wintry feel to your late-night stroll. The cloudy skies hold the promise of impending precipitation, as a mix of rain and snow is expected overnight, with a substantial chance that flurries will dust the landscape before dawn.\n\nLooking ahead to Wednesday, expect a continuation of the cold weather, with a slight chance of snow early on, followed by a transition to partly sunny skies later in the day. Highs will barely register in the mid-30s, and with temperatures likely declining as the afternoon progresses, it will feel increasingly brisk. With a forecasted wind becoming a bit more pronounced, dressing warmly is advisable\u2014layers paired with a sturdy coat should serve you well in these chilly, moist conditions. As for the shoreline, the waves may become lively with the coming weather, so it's best to keep any outdoor plans near the water to a minimum for comfort and safety. \n\nWith winter officially upon us, these temperatures reflect the season's typical chill in this lakeside region. While the beach may not be a preferred destination, cozy indoor activities or a hearty meal by a warm fire would certainly be fitting given the weather's wintery disposition.",
