    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a chilly and damp morning, with a temperature hovering in the low 40s. The air carries a brisk wind from the west, adding to the slightly raw feel of the day. The sky is mostly cloudy, hinting at the likelihood of rain, particularly before mid-morning, before transitioning to rain showers later in the day. Expect temperatures to peak around the upper 40s, yet cool down to the low 40s as the afternoon settles in.\n\nLooking ahead, tonight promises a possibility of rain showers turning into snow, with a low dipping into the low 30s. With the gusty winds stirring, the atmosphere will feel quite blustery, leading to choppy wave conditions on Lake Michigan, which may not be ideal for any recreational activities involving the water. Given the forecast, dressing warmly in layers with a waterproof jacket is advisable to navigate the wet and chilly elements, while boots may come in handy for those heading outside. This late autumn weather pattern is typical for this time of year in the Midwest, as we approach the seasonal transition to winter. Ideal activities for today might include snug indoor gatherings or visits to local caf\u00e9s, where one can enjoy a warm drink while watching the changing weather outside.",
