    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a cool and blustery evening, with temperatures dipping into the low 40s under a blanket of clouds. The wind is howling from the west, making for a crisp atmosphere that might not be the most inviting for a stroll along the beach. As the night settles, expect most of the clouds to linger, although the forecast predicts a low around the freezing mark, accompanied by a gentle breeze.\n\nLooking ahead to Tuesday, the chill continues, with temperatures peaking near the mid 30s before sliding back into the low 30s by afternoon. The winds will remain steady, perhaps providing a slight respite from the cold, but gusts could add a bite to the air. Wave conditions on Lake Michigan may be moderate given the wind, so if you're considering beach activities, heed safety advice. Given the seasonal chill typical for December in this region, dress warmly in layers, opting for sturdy shoes and perhaps a windbreaker to combat the elements. As this evening marks the run-up to the festive holiday season, local events may abound; thus, cozy indoor gatherings could be a perfect way to enjoy the night.",
