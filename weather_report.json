    "weather_report": "As the evening settles in Evanston, the current weather presents a chilly scene marked by light rain, with temperatures hovering in the low 50s. The air carries a damp coolness that might feel slightly uncomfortable for those venturing outdoors, intensified by gusty winds sweeping in from the west-southwest. Light rain has added a sheen to the landscape, creating a muted atmosphere as the sun descends behind a blanket of clouds. \n\nLooking ahead, tonight will bring a shift to partly cloudy skies with a low dropping into the mid-40s and light winds offering a gentle reprieve from the earlier breeze. On Monday, residents can expect a continuation of unsettled weather marked by rain showers beginning mid-morning, with temperatures crawling up to the mid-50s. A 90% chance of precipitation indicates more rain on the way, with gusts potentially reaching 30 mph, making for a blustery day. Given the cool and damp feel, a warm jacket would be advisable, perhaps complemented by waterproof footwear if you plan to step out. These conditions are typical for mid-November in the Midwest, where one might find activities more suited to cozy indoor settings than outdoor adventures by the lake.",
