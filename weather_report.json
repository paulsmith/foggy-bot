    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the current conditions are a chill in the air marked by temperatures hovering in the upper 30s, accompanied by a robust breeze that heightens the cool feel of the day. The sky hangs heavily with clouds, reflecting a muted glow that signals the arrival of patchy fog and drizzle expected later tonight. As we transition into the later hours, the temperature will retreat into the mid-30s, with light winds lessening to a gentle whisper. These conditions create a rather dreary scene, likely discouraging outdoor activities for most.\n\nAs for the waves along Lake Michigan, the forecast suggests a gentle lapping against the shore, given the relatively calm winds. Precipitation will become more pronounced later in the evening, with fog rolling in and possible drizzles that can make the atmosphere feel damp. For those considering venturing outdoors, warm attire is advisable, ideally layered to combat the cool breeze and potential moisture. Overall, this late November weather aligns with the seasonal expectations for this time of year, as cooler temperatures are typical for the region, setting the stage for cozy indoor pursuits likely more appealing than outdoor excursions on this gray afternoon.",
