    "weather_report": "Currently in Evanston, you're greeted by a chilly evening with clouds hanging low, presenting a damp and slightly gloomy atmosphere. The temperature rests comfortably in the mid-30s, accompanied by a brisk westerly breeze that adds a sharpness to the air, heightening the winter's touch. As twilight deepens, you may notice the foreboding signs of winter weather ahead\u2014snow is likely to begin after midnight, bringing with it a 70% chance of light accumulation. \n\nTomorrow morning could see a fleeting chance of snow before 8 AM, fading into mostly sunny skies by the afternoon, but don\u2019t expect temperatures to rise above the mid-30s. With gusty winds, the overall experience outdoors will feel quite brisk and invigorating, perhaps even a bit biting. For those braving the elements, layered clothing is advisable to combat the chill, and a warm coat paired with a hat would offer the most comfort against the wintery wind. Given the season and conditions\u2014this weather is right on cue for a mid-December day in the Midwest, where wintry moods reign supreme. As such, making time for some cozy indoor activities may be preferred for the evening ahead, as the soothing warmth of home contrasts the encroaching chill of the season.",
