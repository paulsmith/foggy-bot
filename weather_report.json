    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the evening air is undeniably crisp and cool, with the temperature hovering in the mid-20s. The sky is mostly cloudy, and as daylight fades, the blustery winds, coming from the northwest, add a chill to the atmosphere, making it feel even more biting. Tomorrow promises a transition as mostly sunny skies emerge, lifting temperatures into the low 30s, though those winds may remain brisk. While there is no precipitation in sight, the waters of Lake Michigan alongside a somewhat calm beach reflect the vividness of a typical winter evening.\n\nAs you venture out, layered clothing is advisable due to the cold and brisk winds, mixing warmth with comfort. This weather is characteristic of early December in the Midwest, maintaining that classic winter feel. Outdoor activities might be limited, but an evening stroll along the beach or a visit to a nearby caf\u00e9 could provide a refreshingly brisk experience. December may not mark a major holiday today, but the festive spirit is palpable as we approach the season's celebrations.",
