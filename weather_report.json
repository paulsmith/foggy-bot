    "weather_report": "As temperatures hover in the low 20s, Evanston is enveloped in a brisk and chilly atmosphere, characteristic of the height of winter. Snow showers are on the horizon, with a forecast suggesting a 20% chance for this evening, while overnight temperatures are expected to rise slightly, hinting at a more robust chance of snow tomorrow. A steady, northeast wind will contribute to the day's cool feel, adding a touch of bite as it swirls through the air. \n\nWith snow accumulating up to several inches projected for Wednesday, getting bundled up in warm layers will be essential. As conditions may turn blustery, it would be wise to don a thick coat, gloves, and perhaps a warm hat, especially if venturing near the shoreline where the lake can whip up waves and splash some chilly spray. The winter weather feel is undoubtedly prominent, typical for this season in the region. Given the conditions, indoor activities might be more appealing\u2014perhaps curling up with a good book or enjoying the warmth of a cup of something hot would suit this wintry evening just fine.",
