    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston paint a rather dreary scene, with the temperature lingering in the mid-50s, creating a crisp but humid atmosphere as light rain continues to fall. The day is overcast, suffused with a thick mist that mingles with the steady rainfall, making visibility limited along the shoreline of Lake Michigan. A howling wind from the southeast adds to the bluster, lending an unmistakable chill to the air and causing the waves to rise and crash against the beach with a ferocity typical of stormy autumn weather.\n\nLooking ahead to the evening and into tomorrow, rain showers will persist, with temperatures expected to hover around the mid-50s. The winds will remain strong, gusting up to 40 mph, which, combined with the rain, will leave the waterfront feeling uninviting and cold. While tomorrow may bring brief respites from the showers in the early hours, the crafting gray clouds will not easily dissipate, and the temperature will drop slightly by afternoon. Those venturing out should don raincoats or waterproof jackets, along with sturdy footwear fit to contend with wet conditions. \n\nGiven the seasonal chill, today's weather is characteristic of late fall in the Midwest, where temperatures typically start to dip, aligning with the forthcoming Thanksgiving holiday. While the rain may deter outdoor activities, it offers a perfect backdrop for cozying up with a book or enjoying warm drinks indoors, staying dry as the waves continue to rage outside.",
