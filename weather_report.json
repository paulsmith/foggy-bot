    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois reveal a chilly afternoon with temperatures hovering in the upper single digits. The air is crisp and cool, with a blustery wind sweeping in from the west, causing wind chill values to dip into the negative. The visibility is good, although the sky presents a mostly cloudy appearance that adds a somber tone to the otherwise serene lakefront view. The beach is relatively calm at the moment, with gentle waves lapping at the shore, though they could pick up slightly given the forecasted wind this afternoon.\n\nLooking ahead, the weather is expected to transition to a partially sunny afternoon, with temperatures climbing into the mid-teens. As night falls, conditions will clear up somewhat, leading to lows around 9 degrees but slightly rising overnight. There is no precipitation in sight, making it a dry day overall. Those venturing outdoors will want to bundle up, perhaps donning insulated jackets, hats, and gloves to ward off the cold and brisk winds. Given that it is December, these temperatures are quite typical for this time of year in the Midwest. As for activities, it\u2019s a good opportunity for a brisk walk along the lakefront, though be prepared for the nippy breeze. This is a standard weekday in December, devoid of any major holidays or events on the calendar.",
