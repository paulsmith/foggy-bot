    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the morning air carries a chill, typical for this time of year, hovering in the mid 20s with a gusty breeze whipping in from the east-southeast. The biting cold is complemented by a dampness that makes the atmosphere feel even brisker, and dark clouds loom overhead, signaling the possibility of mixed precipitation as the day unfolds. As the forecast suggests, temperatures are expected to rise throughout the day, peaking near the upper 30s, setting the scene for a damp but nonetheless typical winter day by Lake Michigan.\n\nThe anticipated weather means it would be wise to dress warmly, with layers to fend off the chill and perhaps a waterproof outer layer to stay dry as rain and patchy drizzle are likely to set in through the afternoon and into the evening. The waves on the lake are choppy, reflecting the blustery conditions, which may not be ideal for outdoor activities by the water but could make for a captivating view from a cozy caf\u00e9 or your home. Given the lack of major holidays today, it might be best to embrace indoor activities such as visiting local museums or enjoying a warm meal at a nearby restaurant as the rain moves in.",
