    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Evanston, the temperature hovers in the low teens, bringing a crisp chill to the air. With a gentle breeze from the northwest, the conditions feel biting yet brisk, making it essential to bundle up for any outdoor endeavors. The sky, currently partly cloudy, offers fleeting glimpses of sunlight, though a slight chance of snow showers looms on the horizon. Waves lap gently against the shore of Lake Michigan, creating a serene, if cool, atmosphere.\n\nLooking ahead, the day promises partly sunny skies, with highs nearing the upper 20s, and a comfortable decline in temperatures by afternoon. Tonight, the sky is expected to clear, dropping to a low in the low 20s, complemented by continued breezy conditions. Given the current season and region, these temperatures are typical for early December, ideal for enjoying festive activities or cozying up with a warm drink. Dress warmly with layers, perhaps incorporating a scarf and gloves, and consider engaging in a brisk walk along the beach or visiting a local caf\u00e9 to savor the season's heartwarming flavors.",
