    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston paint a picture of a chill in the air, with temperatures hovering in the mid 50s, providing a refreshingly cool atmosphere. The afternoon brings mostly cloudy skies, allowing for a gentle mix of light and shadow, yet the threat of rain showers looms slightly as we approach later hours, though the chance remains low. Expect a high near 59, with the wind picking up to a breezy southwest direction, whispering through the trees at 5 to 15 mph, and gusting up to 25 mph.\n\nAs day turns to night, conditions will remain mild, settling down to a low around the mid 40s, allowing for a crisp evening. The waves on Lake Michigan should be calm, but attentive beachgoers may notice an increase in activity if the winds stir things up a bit. Given these conditions, it's sensible to don a light jacket or sweater, ideal for those enjoying a walk by the lake or attending any nearby outdoor events. While not entirely typical for mid-November, the temperatures are certainly in line with seasonal expectations for the region, creating an inviting environment for a stroll along the shore as the sun dips lower. With no holidays on the calendar, it may just be a perfect day to relish the natural beauty of Evanston and take in the sights at the beach.",
