    "weather_report": "The weather in Evanston is currently cool and damp, with temperatures in the low 50s and a thick layer of clouds hanging in the sky. The atmosphere feels somewhat clammy, creating a cozy yet slightly uncomfortable backdrop as a light breeze whispers through the area, adding to the atmospheric chill. Rain showers are expected later tonight, with a likelihood of drizzle and scattered showers continuing into the early hours, further emphasizing the day\u2019s gloomy essence. As we look ahead to Monday, expect persistent drizzle and gray skies, with temperatures peaking around the low 50s before dipping slightly in the afternoon.\n\nGiven the conditions, beach activities may not be ideal today. With the chance of rain and overcast skies, it might be best to stay bundled up in a warm jacket and perhaps carry an umbrella if venturing outside. As the current season aligns with late November, these chilly temperatures are quite typical for this time of year in the Midwest, where residents are accustomed to layering up as winter approaches. While the beach may lack the vibrancy of sunnier days, a stroll along the shoreline to enjoy the sound of the waves or a quiet moment by Lake Michigan could still offer a peaceful retreat in the otherwise overcast ambiance.",
