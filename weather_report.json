    "weather_report": "As evening falls over Evanston, the air is cool and damp, cloaked in a steady drizzle that underscores the transition from fall to winter. Currently, temperatures hover in the low 40s, with a brisk, howling wind adding a chill to the already dreary conditions. Encased in a thick layer of cloud cover, visibility is limited, and the atmosphere is undeniably gloomy. The rain is expected to continue through the night, tapering off to sporadic showers after 1 AM, with precipitation chances lingering at 70%. Those venturing outside will find a raw, unsettling environment, particularly with wind gusts reaching near 35 mph.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the skies will remain overcast, though warmer temperatures will climb to the mid-40s before retreating slightly in the afternoon. The rough surf on Lake Michigan will likely contribute to choppy wave conditions, making for an uninviting view along the shore. It\u2019s advisable to dress warmly\u2014think layers, a waterproof jacket, and a sturdy umbrella to navigate both the elements and the chill in the air. With the Thanksgiving holiday just days away, indoor activities may be more appealing, including cozy gatherings with friends or making preparations for the upcoming feast. Overall, the weather provides a vivid reminder of the season's changing face, steering clear of outdoor escapades in preference for warm, sheltered spaces.",
