    "weather_report": "The current weather in Evanston is characterized by chilly temperatures right around the mid 30s, coupled with a damp, snowy ambiance as light snow falls against a backdrop of dark clouds. Winds are brisk from the west, adding a fierce chill to the air. As we look ahead, the weather tonight offers scattered snow showers, with the temperature dipping slightly to the low 30s, banishing any thoughts of lingering warmth. Tomorrow, expect snow to persist before transitioning to a mix of rain and snow, with temperatures climbing, albeit fleetingly, into the low to mid 40s in the afternoon, accompanied by strong winds that could gust dangerously near 50 mph.\n\nThis weather forecast suggests an unpleasant day outside, especially with the combination of snow and strong winds creating a biting chill. Along the shoreline, wave conditions may become choppy, reflecting the animated winds and accumulating snow, pulling the outdoor scene away from the serene. Dress warmly, layering against the cold and damp; a winter coat, gloves, and sturdy footwear are advisable. The reported temperatures fit the season, as late November in Illinois bears the marks of deepening winter, but today\u2019s wintry mix and wind may feel particularly intense for those venturing out. Suggested activities may be limited to indoor pursuits, like visiting local cafes or museums, as nature's elements may deter longer outdoor excursions\u2014best to enjoy this weather through the warmth of a window, with a warm beverage in hand.",
