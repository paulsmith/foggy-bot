    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston paint a frigid picture, with temperatures sitting in the low 20s, accompanied by a brisk, howling wind from the west that makes the air feel even colder. The sky is cloaked in a thick layer of clouds, casting a muted, gray light over the landscape, while the waves on Lake Michigan are restlessly lapping against the shore. As for precipitation, scattered snow showers are expected before noon, though little accumulation is anticipated.\n\nToday's forecast shows a high nearing the mid-20s, before settling back into the upper teens tonight under mostly clear skies. With gusty winds persisting throughout the day, conditions will feel particularly cold, so warm layers will be essential if venturing outside. The beach may not be the ideal spot for activities today; however, a brisk walk along the shore could be invigorating for those who are dressed appropriately. It\u2019s a typical late fall day in the Midwest, reminding us that winter is on the doorstep, but with a little preparation, there\u2019s still enjoyment to be found in the chill.",
