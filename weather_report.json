    "weather_report": "As we drift deeper into the evening in Evanston, the air hangs cool and damp, a reminder of the light rain that has graced the day. Currently, temperatures linger in the low 50s, accompanied by a gentle, whispering breeze stirring the leaves and the scent of wet earth. The scene is cloaked in a somber ambiance, a mix of moist air and the promise of patchy fog as the night broadens. \n\nLooking ahead, expect a continuation of this damp weather. Tonight, the fog may return after a few hours as clouds partially reveal the night sky, and temperatures will dip into the upper 40s. Tomorrow, the forecast predicts a thicker blanket of clouds with rain showers likely, peaking in the high 50s during the day accompanied by an east wind that could gust up to 30 miles per hour. With precipitation chances hovering at 90%, becoming dreary and soggy seems inevitable.\n\nGiven these conditions, be prepared for a slightly muggy experience tomorrow, and a light jacket or raincoat will serve you well if venturing outside. Ideal for cozy indoor pursuits, it may be best to opt for a quiet afternoon at home with a good book, or if one is adventurous, a stroll along the beach while savoring the refreshing scent of rain-soaked air. Enjoy the evening as another crisp fall night unfolds, with only a few weeks remaining before the holidays bring new cheer and warmth to the season.",
