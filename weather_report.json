    "weather_report": "In Evanston today, conditions are marked by a persistent cloud cover, with temperatures currently lingering in the low 60s, creating a slightly muggy atmosphere that may lead some to seek shelter from the dampness. As the day unfolds, expect a mix of sun and cloudiness, with temperatures gradually sinking toward the mid 50s by the afternoon. Winds will pick up significantly, becoming blustery from the southwest, humming in at speeds around 15 to 25 mph, with gusts reaching up to 35 mph.\n\nTonight will introduce a slight chance of rain showers after 3 AM, culminating in a mostly cloudy night where temperatures dip into the low 40s. The air will feel cooler under the west winds, which will remain gently persistent. Given the season, these temperatures are typical for mid-November in the northern Midwest, making it a cool time of year. For those venturing outside, layering is advisable, favoring lighter jackets or sweaters to accommodate the cooling air. The wave conditions on Lake Michigan may present a few rolling swells, perfect for a brisk stroll along the shoreline or an invigorating jog. As this Sunday is neither a holiday nor an election day, it's a fine opportunity for local outdoor endeavors before the weather turns later in the week.",
