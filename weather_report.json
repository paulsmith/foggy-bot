    "weather_report": "As the day draws to a close in Evanston, current conditions reflect a crisp chill with temperatures dipping into the low 20s, providing a bracing atmosphere invigorated by a gusty northwest wind. The partially cloudy skies lend an open, though somewhat dim, feeling to the scene, with no precipitation forecasted to disrupt the evening. Tonight, you can expect temperatures to settle around 19, accompanied by a gentle breeze that may carry occasional stronger gusts.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the weather will brighten as skies clear to mostly sunny, with temperatures rising to the mid-30s before cooling down again in the afternoon. This seasonal chill, typical for early December in the Midwest, makes it a fine opportunity to dress in layers\u2014think warm coats, hats, and gloves for outside ventures. While the water may be too chilly for a swim, a stroll along the shore could be quite pleasant, especially in the early afternoon when the sun shines brightly. Overall, the conditions invite a brisk walk or a scenic drive along the picturesque Lake Michigan coastline.",
