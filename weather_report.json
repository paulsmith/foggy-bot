    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the current conditions reveal a cool and damp evening, with temperatures hovering in the mid 40s and a cloud-laden sky casting a muted atmosphere. The wind, strong and brisk from the south-southwest, adds a fierce chill to the air, making for a rather chilly experience outdoors. As we look ahead to the day, expect the possibility of light rain showers, particularly overnight, with cloudy skies lingering into Sunday. Though temperatures may rise to the upper 50s by afternoon, the cooling trend will set in, keeping things brisk.\n\nTonight's wave conditions off Lake Michigan are likely to be somewhat choppy, influenced by the gusty winds. As for attire, layering is advisable\u2014consider a warm jacket paired with a hat, as you might encounter periods of precipitation. The temperatures do feel typical for this time of year in the Chicago region, signaling the gradual descent into full winter. Although it's a quiet Saturday, ideal for settling into indoor activities, the weather may prompt some to seek out cozy spots with a warm drink or perhaps enjoy a brisk walk if you can handle the bite in the air.",
