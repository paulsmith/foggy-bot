    "weather_report": "As the evening sets in over Evanston, the temperature is a biting low 20s, with a notable chill carried by strong, gusty winds from the west. The air is clear, offering a crispness that makes the night feel fresh, albeit a touch frigid. Expect temperatures to dip further into the low teens tonight, with wind chills plummeting to near zero, painting an uncomfortable scene for anyone venturing outside. \n\nThe outlook for tomorrow promises a sunny start, but don't let the sunshine fool you; temperatures will hover around the low 20s, feeling even colder with those persistent winds. The lake might churn gently, presenting conditions that aren't ideal for leisurely activities, particularly given the chilly air and the likelihood of biting gusts. It's advisable to bundle up warmly if you plan to step out, as layers will be crucial in battling both the cold and the wind. This late November weather is typical for the region, wrapping up the fall season with that unmistakable chill of approaching winter. For anyone contemplating outdoor plans, perhaps a brief stroll along the shoreline or a warm drink while watching the waves might bring some comfort, though do keep in mind that this is not a night for lingering outside without proper attire.",
