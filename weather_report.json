    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston feature a biting chill, with temperatures dipping into the low single digits, yielding a frosty morning atmosphere. The wind is howling from the northwest at a brisk pace, intensifying the cold and creating wind chill values that plummet well below zero. Today's weather is expected to reveal partly sunny skies, but despite the improved visibility, temperatures will struggle to rise, reaching only near the mid-20s by afternoon. Tonight, the cold front will continue, with lows dipping back to around 10 degrees while remaining partly cloudy. \n\nThe beach at this time remains somber, greeted by rough waters as gusty winds stir up Lake Michigan, creating wave action likely unsuitable for any recreational activities. Precipitation is absent in today\u2019s forecast, but the persistent cold warrants warm layers and perhaps a sturdy hat and gloves to ward off the chill. In this mid-winter season for the Great Lakes region, temperature fluctuations are expected, but today's cold snap is more intense than usual, making typical outdoor activities less than inviting. With no prominent holidays approaching, it's an ideal day for indoor pursuits, perhaps enjoying a warm drink while admiring the resilience of winter from a cozy spot indoors.",
