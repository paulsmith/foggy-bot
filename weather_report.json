    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current conditions present a chilly and blustery morning, with temperatures settling in the low 20s and a strong, gusty wind creating a biting wind chill. The sky is cloudy, enhancing the stark winter atmosphere along the lakeshore. With scattered snow showers tapering off early, the day is expected to transition to mostly sunny, despite a high hovering around the mid-20s. However, chilly temperatures will prevail this afternoon, leading to a cool day overall.\n\nWaves may be moderate, influenced by the brisk winds that could stir up some conditions along the shore, making it unsuitable for swimming or water-related activities. As for attire, it is advisable to dress warmly in layers, wearing hats and gloves to combat the wind chill. Given it's the heart of winter in the Midwest, these temperatures are typical for January. Despite the cold, the sunny intervals could provide a refreshing perspective for a winter walk or a visit to local parks, and with no significant holidays on the horizon, it could offer a quiet winter escape.",
