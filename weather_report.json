    "weather_report": "Current weather conditions in Evanston, Illinois paint a picture of a wintry scene, with temperatures lingering in the upper teens, accompanied by a moist chill that bites at exposed skin. A brisk, howling wind is sweeping in from the north, causing the light snow and fog to swirl, lending an air of stark beauty to the landscape. The picturesque view of Lake Michigan reflects this starkness, presenting gentle waves lapping against the shore, their frothy crests reminiscent of the season\u2019s chill.\n\nLooking ahead, tonight could see increased snowfall, with cloud cover dominating the sky as temperatures hover in the mid-20s, rising slightly overnight. The northern breeze promises a raw, blustery feel, making it imperative to dress warmly for any evening outings. Snow is expected to accumulate lightly, setting the stage for a snowy morning tomorrow, when temperatures will remain in the low 30s accompanied by more significant snowfall\u2014potentially adding a few inches to the winter wonderland. This weather, typical for early January in the Midwest, invites cozy indoor activities or a spirited walk among the flurries, especially given the upcoming holiday cheer just around the corner.",
