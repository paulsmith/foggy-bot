    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently experiencing a chilly evening with a temperature hovering in the upper 20s, under mostly clear skies. The atmosphere is brisk, making it feel particularly crisp and cool outside, ideal for bundled winter attire. As darkness descends, the weather is set to shift; tonight brings a chance of occasional snow flurries, accompanied by overcast conditions and a drop to around 14 degrees. The biting wind from the northwest is expected to pick up, leading to wind chill values plummeting to as low as -5, an indicator of the fierce winter conditions ahead.\n\nLooking forward to Thursday, isolated snow showers may grace the area early in the day, before giving way to bright, sunny intervals. With a forecasted high also in the upper 20s, it's a day to dress warmly, especially given the chance of gusty winds reaching up to 20 mph. Those heading outdoors should be mindful of the potential for snow accumulation and chilly air, well-suited for indoor activities or brief exposure if fully prepared.\n\nAs the waves from Lake Michigan crash against the shore, they may be tumultuous, reflecting the wind\u2019s intensity. Overall, these wintry conditions are quite typical for early December in this region, suggesting a season where snow and cold are expected rather than surprising. Remember to don your warmest layers, as winter is unmistakably here, bringing both challenges and the charm of the season.",
