    "weather_report": "Evanston is waking to a chilly, overcast morning with the temperature hovering in the low 40s. A brisk, blustery southeast wind is making the day feel more pronouncedly cool. The humidity wraps around the air, evoking a crispness that's perfect for cozying up indoors. The beach, though inviting, carries turbulent waters with moderate waves, suggesting a turbulent day ahead. As we look to the afternoon, residents can expect a high reaching into the mid-50s, but with rain expected to roll in after 5 PM, the chance of precipitation stands at 30%. This evening brings a 100% likelihood of rain, with totals likely between half an inch to three-quarters. \n\nGiven the forecast, it would be wise to bundle up in layers for the day ahead, opting for water-resistant jackets and sturdy footwear to navigate the anticipated downpour. Today\u2019s weather feels typical for mid-November in the Midwest, with temperatures and conditions reflecting this late autumn transition. Outdoor activities may be best reserved for short jaunts or quick errands, as the forecasted rainfall and blustery conditions may deter longer ventures along the shoreline. Despite the chilly embrace of November, the beach presents its own rough charm, inviting those willing to brave the elements to experience its wild beauty.",
