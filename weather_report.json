    "weather_report": "In the heart of winter, Evanston, Illinois, is experiencing brisk and chilly conditions, with temperatures hovering just below the freezing mark. The air feels particularly biting, especially with gusts of wind sweeping through at a vigorous pace, creating wind chill values that plunge into the single digits. As of now, the skies are mostly clear, though a cooler breath from the northwest persists, a reminder that winter is unapologetically here.\n\nLooking ahead to the day, residents can expect a mostly sunny sky, although temperatures will struggle to climb much higher, peaking around the low tens before dipping again in the afternoon. Tonight promises to be mostly cloudy, with temperatures that could dip near the freezing mark and winds maintaining their chill. Fortunately, precipitation is absent from the forecast, so conditions are clear for any outdoor plans. As for the lake, while the view may be inviting, those thinking of venturing near the water should prepare for active waves, indicative of the blustery winds. In light of these frosty conditions, layered clothing is highly recommended\u2014think heavy coats, scarves, and warm gloves to keep warmth intact. Given it's a winter day without significant holidays, it\u2019s an opportune time for a cozy walk in the park or to embrace the winter sports opportunities nearby, taking in the snowy scenery that Evanston beautifully offers.",
