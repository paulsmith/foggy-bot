    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the weather is currently marked by a thick shroud of clouds and persistent rain, giving the day a damp and dreary feel. The temperature hovers in the mid 60s, with high humidity creating a muggy atmosphere. Blustery winds from the south southwest buffet the area, reaching near gale force, making it feel a touch chillier as the rain continues to fall. As we look forward to the afternoon, expect a continuation of rain showers with little respite in terms of visibility or comfort, as temperatures are predicted to drop slightly. By tonight, scattered showers will linger into the evening before tapering off, giving way to mostly cloudy skies and cooler temperatures dropping into the low 50s.\n\nAs we observe the waves lapping against the shore of Lake Michigan, one can expect them to be moderately choppy due to the gusty winds, which might deter any thoughts of enjoying the beach. Given the conditions, it\u2019s advisable to dress in layers, opting for waterproof outerwear, and solid footwear if venturing outdoors. The season reflects typical November weather for the Midwest, with the current temperatures aligning closely with what one might expect for this time of year. Interestingly, while the weather isn't conducive for outdoor activities typically enjoyed along the beach, it does provide a cozy backdrop for indoor pursuits like visiting cafes or museums. The day is also notable as it falls just after the recent observance of a major holiday, making it a quiet time to reflect and regroup as we transition into winter.",
