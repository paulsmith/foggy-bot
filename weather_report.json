    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current conditions evoke a chill in the air with a temperature in the mid-30s, accompanied by a brisk and gusty wind sweeping in from the west. The sky is predominantly overcast, cloaked in clouds that hold a muted light over the landscape. The shoreline, quiet and serene, reflects this cloudy atmosphere. As we look forward to the day, temperatures are expected to rise slightly, reaching near 39 degrees, with the breeze calming somewhat, bringing a brief reprieve from the more fierce gusts earlier today. However, as night falls, snow is likely to begin after midnight, wrapping up what appears to be a rather dreary day in a light blanket of white.\n\nWith the potential for precipitation and a cool breeze, it would be wise to dress warmly, opting for layers that offer both insulation and comfort\u2014think of a thick jacket, gloves, and perhaps a warm hat if venturing outside. As this is December, such temperatures are typical for the season, aligning with the wintry landscapes residents have come to expect, though the promise of snow adds a seasonal charm as it approaches. While beach activities may be subdued, a brisk walk along the shore could stir a sense of winter's beauty, perhaps best enjoyed with a warm drink in hand as you watch the waves roll in quietly against the frozen shoreline.",
