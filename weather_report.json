    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Evanston, Illinois, residents can expect a chilly and damp atmosphere, with current temperatures settling in the low 30s. It\u2019s a cloudy day with a brisk wind adding a bite to the air, making it feel significantly cooler. As we move through the day, snow may begin to mix with rain between 3 PM and 5 PM, carrying a 60% chance for precipitation. Highs will struggle to reach the mid-30s, accompanied by a southerly wind around 15 mph, gusting higher, which may create a notable chill along the waterfront.\n\nAs night approaches, snowfall is expected to increase with an 80% chance of precipitation, leaning towards snow and drizzle, and temperatures are forecasted to remain around 30 degrees. The waves on Lake Michigan are likely choppy due to the gusty conditions, adding an element of unease for any wanderers by the shore. Given the weather, layering up is essential; a warm coat, scarf, and waterproof gear would be advisable for those venturing outdoors. While the temperature fits the typical December chill in the Midwest, the wet conditions might deter outdoor activities. Instead, it could be a fitting time for warm drinks by the fireplace or enjoying a cozy evening in.",
