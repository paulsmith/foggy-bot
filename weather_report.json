    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a chilly and raw atmosphere, with temperatures hovering in the mid to upper 30s and a balmy, moist air contributing to a slightly uncomfortable dampness. The mostly cloudy skies shroud the night, with winds whipping in from the northwest, brisk and powerful, generating a notable chill in the air. Tonight, residents can expect a 40% chance of rain through the early hours, followed by patchy drizzle, as temperatures dip to around 40. Those stepping outside should prepare for a blustery evening, as gusts may reach up to 30 mph, making it feel even colder.\n\nLooking forward to Friday, conditions remain cloudy with high temperatures anticipated in the upper 40s, gradually cooling into the afternoon. The winds maintain their vigorous nature, promising a brisk day ahead, which could lead to additional discomfort for those unprepared for such blustery weather. As for the lake, expect wave conditions to be moderate, adding a slightly choppy character to the shoreline. Given this weather, individuals are advised to bundle up in warm, layered clothing, perhaps a sturdy coat, a scarf, and gloves. This time of year aligns with the typical chill of late November in the Midwest, as the region transitions fully towards the winter season. Outdoor plans may need to be adjusted in favor of cozying up indoors, perhaps enjoying the warmth of a beloved spot with friends or family while watching the rain drape over the lakeside.",
