    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois reveal a cool and damp evening, with temperatures nestled in the upper 40s, accompanied by a heavy air that feels rather humid for this time of year. A brisk wind is sweeping in from the north-northwest, creating a somewhat howling atmosphere, particularly near the shoreline of Lake Michigan. The night sky is predominantly overcast, though no precipitation is currently sneaking in to dampen the scene. \n\nAs we look ahead to tomorrow, expect mostly sunny skies, with temperatures climbing into the mid to upper 50s, then gently falling in the afternoon. For those venturing outdoors, a gentle breeze will make for a refreshing day, ideal for layering lightly. Given the season, these temperatures align closely with what one would expect in early November, as the area transitions further into autumn. This would be a suitable day for a leisurely walk along the beach or a visit to the nearby parks, taking in the crisp fall air while watching the waves lap against the shore.",
