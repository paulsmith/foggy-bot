    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a brisk winter scene, with temperatures hovering in the low single digits, accompanied by a blanket of natural stillness in the clear night air. The wind carries a chill, creating wind chill values that plunge well into negative territory, an omen of what one might feel stepping outdoors. As the forecast for Friday unfurls, expect a shift to mostly cloudy skies, though the day may bring a modest high in the upper 20s. With gusts predicted, the air will remain lively and invigorating, likely feeling colder due to the wind.\n\nAs day breaks, the appearance is distinctly wintry and raw. The lake may churn restlessly, with potential waves crashing onto the shore, yet the absence of precipitation will keep the landscape dry. It\u2019s advisable to bundle up with layers, a warm coat, gloves, and perhaps a comfortable hat, as the temperatures are typical for mid-February in this region\u2014a time for cozying up indoors with a good book or braving the cold for a brisk walk along the shoreline. Valentine's Day may lend a romantic hue to indoor pursuits, so consider a warm caf\u00e9 visit to celebrate, or take a moment to appreciate nature\u2019s stark beauty along Lake Michigan.",
