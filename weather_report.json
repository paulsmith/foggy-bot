    "weather_report": "As evening settles over Evanston, current conditions reveal a cool, partly cloudy sky with temperatures in the mid-50s. The air carries a refreshing crispness, making it a comfortable moment for a stroll. Looking forward, tonight\u2019s forecast suggests that the skies will remain partly cloudy with a gentle breeze picking up from the west, likely providing a playful rustle among the trees. Tomorrow, Veterans Day, promises mostly sunny conditions, although temperatures are expected to dip into the low 40s in the afternoon, accompanied by more blustery winds that could bring gusts up to 30 mph.\n\nThe absence of any significant precipitation adds to the pleasantness of the scene, perfect for an evening walk along the beach or a quiet moment enjoying the lakefront view. With the cool temperatures typical for November in the Midwest, layering is recommended; consider a light jacket to stay comfortable. Tonight might be a lovely time to unwind outdoors, perhaps with friends or family, while soaking in the tranquil atmosphere before the chill sets in later.",
