    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the prevailing conditions are decidedly chilly, with frost in the air and a biting wind whistling down from the northwest. Currently, temperatures hover in the low single digits, accompanied by a dash of humidity that makes the bitter cold feel even harsher. As night settles in, visibility is clear, unlikely to hold any threat of precipitation. The forecast for the day ahead promises mostly sunny skies, though temperatures are predicted to rise only into the mid-teens \u2014 a stark contrast to the freezing chill that will emerge in the morning, when wind chill values will plummet to dangerous lows.\n\nWith the landscape demure and still under the cloak of night, this wintry scene is better suited for warm layers, with hats and gloves strongly advised. Despite the cold, the beach could still attract those eager for solitude or winter walks along the shore \u2014 perhaps even some joggers braving the elements to savor the invigorating embrace of winter air. As the holiday season approaches, with festivities soon to unfold, the delightful spirit of the season brings a warmth that contrasts sharply with the current temperature.",
