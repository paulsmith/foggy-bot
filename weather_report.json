    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Evanston, the weather is predominantly cloudy, with a gentle murmur of rain showers soon to intensify. Currently, the temperature hovers in the mid-50s, paired with a brisk breeze from the southeast that brings a hint of chill, making it feel a little cooler. As the forecast unfolds, expect the temperatures to peak close to 61, before slipping slightly as precipitation becomes more prominent. By tonight, there's a guaranteed soaking, with strong chances of thunderstorms rolling through as temperatures rise to the low 60s. Rainfall could accumulate between a quarter and half an inch, so those venturing out should be prepared for a thoroughly damp experience.\n\nWhile the beach offers a dramatic view of Lake Michigan\u2019s choppy waters, conditions may not be ideal for a leisurely stroll along the shore. The waves are moderate today, possibly enticing to the adventurous surfer, but certainly not welcoming for casual beachgoers. With rain looming, it would be wise to don waterproof attire and sturdy shoes. As late autumn in the Midwest typically brings cooler temperatures and fluctuating weather, today\u2019s conditions align somewhat with the season\u2019s expected briskness. Given these circumstances, indoor activities like visiting local cafes or museums may prove more enjoyable than braving the elements outdoors.",
