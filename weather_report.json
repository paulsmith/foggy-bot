    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current conditions are biting cold, with temperatures hovering in the mid-20s, and a blustery wind making it feel even more frigid. The air is clear, offering a crisp view, but the harsh wind chill might deter outdoor enthusiasts. Tonight, temperatures will drop further to the low teens, paired with a gentle southwest breeze, providing a tranquil evening under mostly clear skies. As we look ahead to Saturday, the sun will make an appearance, warming the high to around the mid-30s, albeit with temperatures slipping back into the low 30s during the afternoon as the wind picks up again.\n\nOverall, the scene is far from inviting for leisurely lakeside activities; the beach may be somewhat subdued, and the wave conditions could reflect a slight chop due to the ongoing gusty winds. For those braving the elements, it\u2019s wise to don layering attire\u2014think thick coats, gloves, and perhaps a warm hat to mitigate the biting chill. Given that it\u2019s winter in the Midwest, while the temperatures are indeed reflective of the season, they do lean toward the colder end of the spectrum. With the sun's brief visit anticipated tomorrow, one might consider bundling up for brisk walks or quick outdoor errands, making the most of the fleeting sunshine.",
