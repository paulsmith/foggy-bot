    "weather_report": "In Evanston this morning, the air is crisp and cool with a temperature hovering in the low 20s, accompanied by light flurries dusting the ground. As the morning progresses, expect scattered snow showers to taper off by noon, giving way to mostly sunny skies with a high reaching the upper 20s. Winds from the west northwest are gentle, adding a slight chill to the already brisk atmosphere. The day promises a pleasant, though rather nippy, afternoon as the sun breaks through the clouds.\n\nWhile wave conditions along the lake may produce some choppy waters due to the light snowfall earlier, conditions should stabilize as the day unfolds. Those venturing outdoors should opt for warm, layered clothing\u2014perhaps a sturdy winter coat, gloves, and a scarf\u2014to combat the chill. Given the current season and regional climate norms, these temperatures are typical of early February in Illinois. Local activities could include a brisk walk along the shoreline, ideal for enjoying the scenery, though more adventurous spirits may want to stay close to indoor comforts until later in the day, when the sun shines down on Evanston.",
