    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston are chilly, with temperatures hovering in the mid 30s and a blustery wind adding a bite to the air. The sky remains overcast, casting a muted light across the landscape. Looking ahead, the overnight forecast predicts snow, with a significant chance of precipitation at 90%. Expect a low around freezing, accompanied by gentle winds shifting from the north-northwest. Snow flurries may linger into Wednesday morning, but there\u2019s only a 30% chance of accumulation as temperatures transition to the low 30s by the afternoon.\n\nOverall, the day may feel rather dreary, encapsulated by the cold and overcast sky. Meanwhile, wave conditions on Lake Michigan could be unsettled given the gusty winds. Attire that is warm and waterproof is advisable, featuring layers and sturdy footwear to combat the wet and cold. This period in mid-December is typical for the region, reflecting the stark chill of a Chicago winter, and suggests indoor activities may be the best option as the holiday season approaches, perhaps cozying up with a good book or exploring local cafes rather than venturing outdoors.",
