    "weather_report": "As evening settles over Evanston, the air is crisp and cool, with temperatures hovering in the upper 20s, and a robust wind sweeping in from the northwest, creating a biting sensation on exposed skin. The sky remains enveloped in a thick veil of clouds, suggesting an impending shift in the weather, particularly with forecasted intermittent snow showers tonight, likely beginning later on, though spatially scattered, with a low settling around the low 20s.\n\nTomorrow, expect a morning flurry or two, giving way to a mix of sunshine and clouds as the day unfolds, with the high struggling a bit to reach the mid-20s. The winds will continue to be brisk, adding to the chill, so prepare for a blustery day along the shoreline where the waves might churn slightly, though not dangerously so. With these conditions, dressing warmly in layers is advised\u2014think insulated jackets, hats, and gloves to fend off the cold and wind. While outdoor activities may be limited by the weather, the beach will have its own stark beauty, ideal for a contemplative walk or photography against the wintery backdrop, especially since this is a routine weekday without major celebrations on the horizon.",
