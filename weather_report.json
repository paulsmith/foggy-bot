    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reflect a chilly evening, with temperatures resting in the mid-30s. The air carries a biting chill as light snow flurries drift, driven by a wild wind gusting from the west at nearly 54 mph, creating an atmosphere that feels both brisk and raw. Visibility is dim, with clouds shrouding the sky, offering a muted view toward Lake Michigan. Tonight's forecast suggests scattered rain and snow showers, with temperatures dropping slightly to around freezing. The gusty winds are expected to continue, adding a fierce bite to the already frigid air. \n\nAs for attire, a heavy coat, warm hat, and gloves are essential to combat the cold and blustery conditions. While the atmosphere is undeniably wintry, those who enjoy brisk walks bundled in warmth may find the evening refreshing, though anyone venturing outdoors should be cautious of the potentially slick conditions. Temperatures typical for this time of year in Evanston usually hover in the low to mid-30s, so tonight's chill falls within the expected seasonal norms. Given the weather, a cozy night indoors with a warm beverage would be a more pleasant retreat than attempting outdoor activities.",
