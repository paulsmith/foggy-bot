    "weather_report": "As the chilly winds whip through Evanston, current conditions reveal a raw and brisk atmosphere with temperatures hovering in the low 30s, complemented by a mostly cloudy sky. The gusty winds, reaching a fierce pace, create a biting chill that underscores the need for warm attire if venturing outside. This afternoon, the forecast promises a slight reprieve with partly sunny skies and a high near the upper 30s, but the winds will remain blustery, reaching up to 25 mph, with gusts potentially soaring to 40 mph, making the air feel even cooler.\n\nThe late afternoon gives way to clearer, albeit chilly conditions, dropping to the low teens by nightfall, as strong winds persist from the west-northwest. The beachfront, while possibly inviting for a walk, may not offer ideal boating conditions due to the choppy waters. As the Lake Michigan waves rise and roll with vigor, potential amiable diversions such as a brisk stroll along the shore might be better suited for those wrapped in layers, seeking fresh air and a taste of winter\u2019s stark beauty. Today is not marked by any notable holiday, but with Valentine's Day approaching, one could take solace in the craggy, rugged charm of Evanston's winter landscape while preparing for celebrations ahead.",
