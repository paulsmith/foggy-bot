    "weather_report": "Current weather conditions in Evanston, Illinois present a brisk and cool atmosphere, with temperatures in the mid-40s and a fresh breeze making the air feel invigorating. The sky bears scattered clouds, allowing some sunshine to peek through, though changing conditions are on the horizon with expected rain showers this afternoon, particularly after 3 PM, as temperatures will gradually dip to the low 40s. Winds are fairly strong from the west southwest, gusting significantly, giving the day a blustery character. \n\nAs the evening approaches, clouds will thicken with scattered snow showers likely, and temperatures will settle around the low 30s. Precipitation chances rise, suggesting an active sky ahead but little to no accumulation for the snowfall. The shoreline might not be the ideal spot for leisure activities today, given the winds and potential showers; however, it might offer a beautiful backdrop for a brisk walk. For those venturing out, wearing layers with a warm coat, hat, and gloves is advisable, paired with sturdy footwear to navigate any wet terrain. Today\u2019s temperatures are typical for late November in the Midwest, capturing that distinctly cool and transitional season feel.",
