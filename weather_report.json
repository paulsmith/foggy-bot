    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently experiencing chilly and blustery conditions, with the temperature hovering in the low 30s and a hefty breeze whipping across the area, making it feel even colder. The sky is cloaked in cloud cover, adding a somber tone to the landscape, particularly as nightfall approaches. As for the forecast, expect mostly cloudy skies to continue tonight, with temperatures dipping to the upper 20s, accompanied by a gentler wind, though gusts may still stir the air.\n\nTomorrow, residents can anticipate a chance of snow showers developing after noon, with temperatures struggling to reach the low 30s before falling back to the low 20s in the afternoon. This means light snow accumulation is possible, but nothing significant is expected. The current seasonal temperature is typical for December in this region, painting a quintessentially Wintry scene at the lakefront, where the waves may be choppy due to the gusty winds. Given these conditions, it\u2019s advisable to bundle up in warm layers and possibly don waterproof attire\u2014some mittens and a thick scarf would be wise as outdoor activities will come with a brisk bite in the air, making it a perfect day for cozy indoor pursuits or enjoying the winter landscapes from the warmth of indoors.",
