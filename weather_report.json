    "weather_report": "Currently in Evanston, the air is brisk and somewhat damp, with temperatures hovering in the upper 40s, and a substantial wind sweeping in at a blustery pace from the west, making it feel noticeably cooler. The sky is draped in thick clouds, casting a muted gray over the environment, complementing the chill of the day. As we look ahead, the weather will remain mostly cloudy, with a high today reaching into the low 50s before dipping to the low 30s tonight. Winds will remain steady but should ease slightly, creating a somewhat calmer atmosphere in the evening.\n\nFor those heading outdoors, it's best to dress warmly, as the damp chill combines with the wind to create an uncomfortable bite. As for water conditions on Lake Michigan, expect moderate waves, making it less than ideal for swimming or water sports. Given the calendar, today may find people preferring indoor activities or cozy gatherings, especially with the season's chill intensifying as winter approaches. Without a significant holiday on the horizon, the focus today will likely be on enjoying seasonal pastimes while staying bundled up.",
