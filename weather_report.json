    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Evanston, current conditions reveal a brisk morning with temperatures hovering in the low single digits, accompanied by a thick atmosphere that feels biting due to the chilly winds. These winds are whispering from the west, and although the sky is clear for now, the overall feel remains quite frosty. \n\nToday\u2019s forecast indicates a shift toward more moderate temperatures, warming into the low 20s, but with a sharp chill factor that may plunge perceived temperatures as low as -8 degrees. A mostly sunny demeanor will grace the day but may give way to light snow showers later tonight, introducing some cloudiness; temperatures are expected to rise slightly overnight. The lake, typically restless in winter, may have some gentle waves, but with snow on the horizon later in the evening, any plans you have along the shoreline should consider the possible precipitation. Dress warmly in layers, with hats and gloves, to combat the cold bite. Though we are still firmly in the heart of winter, today\u2019s temperatures are aligned with typical January highs for this region. Outdoor activities may be limited, but a brisk walk along the beach could be invigorating if one is prepared for the cold.",
