    "weather_report": "A chilly afternoon settles over Evanston, Illinois, with temperatures hovering in the mid 20s and a brisk northwesterly breeze adding a sharp bite to the air. As clouds drift across the sky, the day maintains a partly cloudy demeanor, bringing a feel of stark beauty to the lakeshore. Conditions are rather blustery, with winds sweeping in at around 15 mph, gusting up to 30 mph, making it a day best suited for bundling up. The waves along Lake Michigan are moderate, reflecting a restless but mesmerizing surface that catches the light intermittently.\n\nAs evening approaches, the temperature is expected to dip further to the mid-teens, and while precipitation remains absent, the crisp air may invite the occasional chill, making a cozy night indoors the preferred choice. Given the seasonal chill of December, these temperatures are typical; winter's grip is firmly established, urging residents to don their warmest coats, hats, and gloves. Outdoor enthusiasts might consider a brisk walk by the lake or enjoying the serene, wintry landscape, but do so remembering the need for warmth amidst the cool and blustery conditions.",
