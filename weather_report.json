    "weather_report": "As we take a moment to dwell on the current weather conditions in Evanston, Illinois, we find ourselves cloaked in a chilly embrace. The air sits at a brisk temperature in the mid-30s, saturated with moisture that gives it a damp and raw feeling. Gusty winds from the southeast, whipping at nearly 50 mph, contribute to a wild ambiance, while light rain adds a somber touch to the coastal scene. The shoreline of Lake Michigan is obscured by thick fog, reducing visibility and enhancing an atmosphere that feels both quiet and restless.\n\nLooking ahead, tonight\u2019s forecast promises an unyielding continuation of rain, tapering into drizzles as the night deepens, with temperatures inching up into the low 40s. Tomorrow brings more of the same, with cloudy skies and scattered areas of drizzle expected before 3 PM, leaving us with a chilly and enveloping fog for the day. Given these conditions, venturing outdoors would be better suited with waterproof attire to brave the impending rain and a warm jacket to fend off the evening\u2019s chill. With winter still around the corner, the current temperatures are typical for this time of year in the Midwest, making it a rather dreary prelude to the holiday season. While outdoor activities may be curtailed by the weather, those with a penchant for cozy indoor pursuits may find solace in curling up with a good book or enjoying a warm drink.",
