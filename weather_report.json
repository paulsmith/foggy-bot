    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather paints a picture of a crisp, mostly cloudy afternoon with temperatures hovering in the upper 50s, accompanied by a gentle humidity that adds a slight dampness to the air. As the sun begins its descent, expect a shift as later forecasts promise partly sunny skies. This afternoon will see temperatures rising briefly to the low 60s before a light breeze transitions into a blustery west-southwest wind, bringing gusts that could reach up to 35 miles per hour.\n\nAs the day slips into evening, the weather will shift to partly cloudy skies with temperatures dipping to the upper 40s, wrapped in a cool wind that may be felt more keenly by the lakeshore. While no precipitation is on the radar, the fresh air, combined with the dance of clouds, provides a lovely backdrop for outdoor activities. Given the season, this November day is typical for the region, suggesting layers might be necessary to stay comfortable. For those venturing outside, a warm jacket and perhaps a hat would complement the brisk conditions nicely, making it a perfect opportunity for an invigorating stroll along the beach or enjoying the last rays of the sun as it reflects off Lake Michigan\u2019s surface.",
