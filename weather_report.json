    "weather_report": "Evanston, Illinois, is currently experiencing a chilly day marked by mostly cloudy skies and a brisk wind, making the air feel refreshingly crisp. The temperature hovers in the mid 20s, complemented by a strong, gusty breeze that could make it feel even colder. With no precipitation in sight, visibility is clear, allowing for a view across the beach towards Lake Michigan, where the water's gentle ripples reflect the muted tones of the overcast sky.\n\nAs we look to the forecast for later today and into tonight, expect the temperature to climb toward the low 40s with a gradual decrease in cloud cover. Winds will lessen slightly but remain quite breezy from the southwest, keeping it feeling a bit chilly. It\u2019s advisable to dress warmly with layers and perhaps wear a windbreaker to shield against the cool gusts. For those contemplating outdoor activities, the late afternoon may present better opportunities for a stroll by the lakeshore or enjoying the serenity at the park, though anticipate a brisk feel in the air suitable for brisk walking or light jogging, especially as the sun begins to set and temperatures drop again into the evening.",
