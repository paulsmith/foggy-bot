    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather is quite gloomy with temperatures lingering in the chill of the high 40s, accompanied by a heavy, humid feel due to the considerable moisture in the air. It's a night marked by persistent rain and a shroud of fog, creating a somber yet serene atmosphere near the lake. The wind is notably brisk, blowing at a pace that can stir up a chill, reaching nearly 25 miles per hour, and is set to shift gears tonight, providing a gusty backdrop to the already wet conditions.\n\nLooking ahead, the rain will continue through tonight, with lows hovering around the upper 40s and a gradual rise to the low 50s as the night progresses. It's projected that the rain will ease off somewhat by Thursday afternoon, though there\u2019s still a reasonable likelihood of showers ahead. For those contemplating a venture outdoors, layers would be wise, given the dampness and chill; waterproof attire and a sturdy umbrella are essential. The conditions are typical for mid-November in this region\u2014a time when temperatures often fall into this uninviting range. While outdoor activities may be limited to cozy gatherings indoors, engaging in a good book or enjoying a warm cup of coffee while listening to the rain might provide a pleasant escape from the dampness.",
