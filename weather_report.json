    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently experiencing blustery conditions, with temperatures hovering in the mid 50s and high humidity giving the air a damp feel. The sky is mostly cloudy, leaving a touch of gray that suggests some rain may be lurking nearby. A chance of showers looms between noon and 4 PM, bringing with it a 30% chance of precipitation. As we look ahead, the forecast hints at a transition to partly sunny skies with a high temperature nudging toward 60 degrees before it begins to drop in the afternoon. Winds are expected to remain gusty, contributing to a bit of a chill in the air.\n\nGiven the current conditions, it\u2019s advisable to dress in layers, incorporating a light jacket to fend off the breeze, especially with wind gusts reaching up to 35 mph. These temperatures are typical for November in the Midwest, a season that often brings these kind of cool, variable days. As for activities, the beach could see some visitors braving the wind for a refreshing walk along the shore or enjoying the scenery of Lake Michigan, although those hoping to swim would do best to wait for warmer weather. This weekend day holds promise for both relaxation and brisk outdoor activity, provided one is aware of the potential for rain and dresses accordingly.",
