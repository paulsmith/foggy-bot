    "weather_report": "The evening in Evanston, Illinois paints a rather brisk portrait, with temperatures in the low 40s and a robust, howling wind sweeping in from the northwest. The air is thick with a moist chill that wraps around you, making it feel colder than it is\u2014perfectly typical for late November in this part of the Midwest. Looking ahead, the night promises to usher in mostly cloudy skies, with temperatures dipping to around the high 20s, while gusty winds will continue to stir along the shoreline, occasionally reaching up to 30 mph.\n\nTomorrow greets us with sunny intervals, featured prominently in the afternoon, as temperatures rise to the high 30s before settling back down in the mid-30s. Waves may be moderately impactful, affected by the strong winds, making it less than ideal for leisurely strolls near the lake. Given the wintry conditions and the season, cozy layers are recommended for outdoor ventures; a warm coat, scarf, and sturdy boots will serve you well. As the holiday season approaches, this unceremonious weather serves as a stark reminder of the season's chill, amplifying that festive spirit ever so slightly.",
