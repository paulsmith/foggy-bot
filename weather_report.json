    "weather_report": "The current weather in Evanston is characterized by a brisk chill, with temperatures hovering in the mid-teens. A blustery west wind sends a sharp bite through the air, while the relatively high moisture content adds to a feeling of cold. With the day breaking, conditions are partly cloudy and remain quite gray, though some isolated snow showers may briefly interrupt the scene before noon. As the day advances, temperatures are expected to peak in the mid-20s before dipping back to the low teens tonight, accompanied by a wind chill that could plummet to around zero, urging residents to seek warmth.\n\nWave conditions along Lake Michigan are likely to remain moderate, offering a stark contrast to the otherwise still environment. Given the cool climate, it's advisable to dress in layers, opting for warm clothing, gloves, and a hat if venturing outdoors. The temperatures align with typical winter weather for this region, as Evanston settles into its seasonal rhythm. While outdoor activities may be limited due to the cold, brisk beach walks could invigorate those eager to embrace the Lake\u2019s winter beauty. As the year draws to a close, December festivities loom on the horizon, setting a festive tone amidst the winter chill.",
