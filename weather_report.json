    "weather_report": "As evening descends on Evanston, the weather presents a crisp and cool atmosphere, with current temperatures lingering in the low 60s. The gentle breeze from the west-southwest carries a hint of invitational warmth yet stirs a refreshing coolness, making outdoor activities delightful but perhaps a bit brisk for some without adequate layers. Partly cloudy skies allow glimpses of the fading sun, casting a gentle glow over the landscape as daylight wanes.\n\nLooking ahead into the evening, the forecast suggests a transition to mostly cloudy skies, with temperatures dipping into the low 40s, potentially punctuated by a chance of rain after 3 AM. Thus, if you're venturing out this evening, consider a warm jacket and perhaps a light raincoat, as those storm clouds may roll in. The lake's surface should display relatively mild wave conditions, suitable for a calm evening stroll along the shore but perhaps not ideal for more vigorous water activities. Such conditions beckon for quiet walks, reflecting on a serene lakeside, as the warmth of the day softly gives way to the cool embrace of night.",
