    "weather_report": "As evening falls on Evanston, temperatures linger in the low 20s, creating a chilly atmosphere under a blanket of clouds. The air feels cold and a bit damp, giving an edgy bite to the breeze as it stirs softly through the park. Tonight, expect predominantly cloudy skies, with temperatures poised to rise slightly as the night progresses, accompanied by a gusty south-southwest wind picking up to 15-20 mph, with potential gusts reaching up to 40 mph. The conditions will remain brisk but bearable, typical for early December in this region.\n\nLooking ahead to Wednesday, the weather will bring scattered snow showers in the afternoon, with temperatures peaking in the upper 30s before sliding back into the low 30s. The winds will be strong, adding a wild chill to the air as we anticipate a 50% chance of snow\u2014but little accumulation is expected. Given these conditions, it may be best to dress warmly, layering up in insulated clothing and windbreakers. While beach walks might not be inviting, the charm of the holiday season makes indoor activities like visiting local cafes or shops more appealing as winter sets in.",
