    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a brisk and cloudy atmosphere, with temperatures in the low 50s and a notable gustiness from the south, contributing to a chill in the air. As the day progresses, expect mostly cloudy skies with temperatures holding steady as they dip slightly in the afternoon. A slight chance of rain showers looms after midnight, but for now, the chance of getting caught in a downpour is minimal.\n\nDespite the cooler temperatures and overcast skies, the beach may still attract those seeking a refreshing stroll along the shore or a vigorous walk. However, the conditions are not ideal for swimming thanks to the choppy waves stirred up by the brisk winds, which could also make any outdoor activities feel a bit raw, so layered clothing would be advisable. As we embrace mid-November in the Midwest, today's weather reflects typical fall conditions\u2014occasionally chilly with the hint of winter approaching. With no significant holidays on the horizon, it's a day best enjoyed with a warm drink in hand while taking in the beautiful, if not blustery, lakeside views.",
