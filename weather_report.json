    "weather_report": "Evanston is waking up to a chilly and brisk morning, where the temperature hovers in the mid-teens. The air feels quite crisp, and with a gentle breeze stirring, it certainly has the makings of a wintry day. The sky, while mostly clear at the moment, will shift later as clouds roll in, signaling a transition to partly sunny weather by midday, with a high near the low 30s expected. Tonight, the clouds will thicken further, and temperatures will rise slightly, leading to a low around the mid-20s as a milder southwest wind picks up.\n\nWave conditions along Lake Michigan are likely to reflect the blustery winds, creating a somewhat wild scene at the waterfront, though no precipitation is forecasted today. As you prepare for the day, layering up will be crucial; a warm winter coat, gloves, and perhaps a hat will ensure comfort against the biting chill. In context, this temperature is typical for early December in this region, capturing that unmistakable winter essence; snow may not be in sight yet, but the season\u2019s presence is unmistakable. Ideal activities include a brisk walk by the beach to enjoy the fresh air or cozying up in a warm caf\u00e9 nearby. Today, the atmosphere is all about embracing the winter chill, rather than retreating from it.",
