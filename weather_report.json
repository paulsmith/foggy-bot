    "weather_report": "Good morning, Evanston. Currently, the temperature hovers in the upper 20s, accompanied by a robust, gusty wind that whips through the air. The scene is marked by light snow, creating a brisk and biting atmosphere, perfect for those who might appreciate the winter's bite but daunting for the more sensitive. Expect a snowy day ahead, with continued cloud cover and temperatures barely nudging near 30 degrees before taking a slight dip this afternoon. The east-northeast winds will contribute to a chilly feel, with gusts that may catch you off guard. As the day progresses, anticipate significant snowfall, with new accumulation possibly reaching up to 4 inches.\n\nTonight the region will see ongoing snow, tapering off as the low settles into the upper teens. The drive home may be less than pleasant with the potential for slick roads. Waves on Lake Michigan are likely to be choppy, stirred by the fierce winds, though this might not be the best day to test the waters. Given the blustery conditions, a warm winter coat, sturdy boots, and perhaps a hat and gloves are highly recommended to keep the chill at bay. While February can often bring such wintry weather, today's conditions reflect the typical chill of a Midwestern winter, reminding us that it's still very much the season for cozy indoor activities. With no major holidays on the horizon, it may be a fine evening to enjoy a warm drink by the fire or a movie night indoors, away from the frosty elements outside.",
