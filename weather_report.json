    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the current weather is chilly and overcast, with temperatures sitting in the mid-30s and a fierce breeze sweeping in from the southeast. The atmosphere feels damp and brisk, setting a rather dreary tone for the afternoon. As we look ahead, rain is expected to arrive after 3 PM, with clouds thickening and temperatures struggling to rise above the upper 30s. The chance of precipitation is significant, and the winds will remain gusty, further complicating outdoor plans.\n\nThe beach scene reveals choppy waters and a muted sky, suggesting that wave conditions may be a bit tumultuous, especially with the approaching rainfall. Given the circumstance, it's prudent to dress warmly in layers, and perhaps to bring an umbrella if venturing outdoors, as the rainfall tonight could be steady, accompanied by areas of fog. This time of year typically sees temperatures in the mid-30s to low 40s, making today's chilliness rather typical for December in the Midwest. Outdoor activities may be limited, with options better suited for staying cozy indoors or engaging in brief outings to enjoy the brisk air, while keeping an eye on the incoming rain.",
