    "weather_report": "As evening descends upon Evanston, the air feels crisp with current temperatures lingering in the low 40s, complemented by a substantial overcast sky. A blustery northwest wind whistles briskly, keeping the chill in the atmosphere palpable. The beach looks stark, suggesting the waves are likely to be somewhat restless given the wind's ferocity, creating a somewhat moody yet soothing setting. Tonight, expect cloudy skies to dominate, with temperatures dipping towards the high 30s as a gusty wind persists, adding a bite to the already cool conditions.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the clouds will remain as the day unfolds, with a high near the mid-40s that will gradually give way to even cooler afternoon readings. This time of year, as we approach Thanksgiving, such temperatures are seasonally typical for the Midwest, signaling the transition fully into late autumn's embrace. Recommended attire would include layered clothing and a wind-resistant jacket to stave off the chill. For those feeling adventurous, a brisk walk along the beach or through local parks could be invigorating, even if the scenery is slightly subdued. Special occasions are in the air, as families prepare for the upcoming holiday, wrapping up the year with gratitude and warmth despite the cooling temperatures.",
