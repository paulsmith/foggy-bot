    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the morning unfolds with a chilly embrace, as temperatures hover in the low 30s under a shroud of light snow and fog. Conditions feel damp and brisk, with a mist subtly softening the shoreline's edges as it creeps toward Lake Michigan. The day ahead promises more wintry weather, with forecasts indicating steady snow throughout, leading to a high around 35 degrees before dipping to near 31 in the afternoon. Winds will be strong and gusty, stirring up the atmosphere, making for a rather wintry scene by the lakeshore.\n\nAs snow falls and blankets the ground, the beach presents a serene yet somber sight, the waves rolling gently amid the relentless chill. Precipitation is likely to accumulate, adding another layer to the landscape; ideal for those who appreciate the stark beauty of a snowy day. Given the current season, bundle up in warm layers, perhaps a coat, hat, and gloves, to combat the biting wind and cold air. This chilly atmosphere isn't unusual for December, with temperatures falling right in line with seasonal expectations. The weather might not be inviting for outdoor pursuits, but a winter walk along the beach could provide a quiet escape, or perhaps a cozy afternoon inside with a book and hot drink as the snow continues to fall.",
