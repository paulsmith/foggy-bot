    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently experiencing a warm, humid evening with temperatures in the upper 60s, wrapped in a dense blanket of cloud cover. Although breezes are gentle, they lend no relief from the sticky atmosphere, making it feel quite muggy. As we move into the evening, rain is likely to start before sunset, with clouds thickening and an increasing chance for thunderstorms later in the night, bringing potentially significant rainfall.\n\nGiven the approaching precipitation, the beach's usual appeal might dwindle this afternoon as storms set in. The waves are likely to remain calm in the fading daylight, but prepare for choppy waters as winds pick up overnight. It\u2019s advisable to bundle up in a light jacket or raincoat if venturing outdoors. With the current conditions being typical for early November\u2014neither too hot nor too cold\u2014activities such as a cozy indoor gathering or exploring local cafes would be more appealing than a stroll along the shore. Tonight, as rain showers loom and temperatures drop slightly, a slow, relaxed evening indoors seems most fitting.",
