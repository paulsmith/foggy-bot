    "weather_report": "Evanston is waking up to a brisk morning with temperatures hovering in the low 20s, lending a sharpness to the air that underscores the winter season. While the skies are mostly cloudy, the day is set to transition to mostly sunny, offering a glimpse of brighter moments ahead. The wind is rather fierce, whipping through at a blustery pace, which may make it feel even cooler than the thermometer suggests. Expect a high near the mid 30s today, dropping to a low around the teens as night falls, accompanied by a westward wind that could stir up more than just the leaves.\n\nThe beach may appear serene yet chilly, and the wave conditions will likely reflect the currents brought by this robust wind. There seems to be no precipitation in today\u2019s outlook, making it a clear day for outdoor ventures, albeit bundled up. With these conditions prevailing, layering up with warm attire is essential\u2014think sturdy winter jackets, gloves, and perhaps a hat to fend off the cold. It\u2019s a typical winter's day in the Midwest, where venturing outdoors could be invigorating, especially for those who enjoy the quiet stillness of a lakeside stroll or a brisk jog along the shoreline. \n\nAs the day unfolds, many might consider a warm drink to accompany their outdoor explorations, or perhaps even a trip to one of Evanston's cozy coffee shops, a perfect respite from the cold. With no major holidays looming today, it\u2019s an ordinary but beautifully chilly winter day on the shores of Lake Michigan, inviting those who cherish the cold to embrace the season fully.",
