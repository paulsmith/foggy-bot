    "weather_report": "Conditions in Evanston, Illinois, feature a chilly winter feel, with temperatures lingering in the mid 10s. The air is crisp and slightly biting due to a ferocious breeze sweeping in from the northwest at notable speeds, bringing a refreshing chill that could make for a brisk outing. The beach scene reveals clear skies, contributing to a pleasant appearance, though the wind churns up notable wave action on Lake Michigan, suggesting caution for any water activities.\n\nToday's forecast promises sunny intervals, but temperatures are expected to climb only into the upper 20s, falling back to the mid-teens tonight under partly cloudy skies. With no precipitation expected, it remains a dry day, ideal for bundled outdoor adventures. Recommended attire includes heavy winter coats, scarves, and sturdy footwear, particularly if venturing near the shoreline where sand meets the winter waves. Given the season, these temperatures are typical for early December in this region, embodying the heart of winter. Those looking to enjoy the outdoors should consider brisk walks or a visit to local parks, making the most of the clear yet brisk day.",
