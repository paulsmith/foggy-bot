    "weather_report": "Current weather conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly afternoon, with temperatures hovering in the mid 30s. The atmosphere feels crisp due to a noticeable breeze sweeping in from the west, making it feel slightly brisk along the shoreline. Though the skies are mostly cloudy, visibility remains fair over Lake Michigan, offering a subdued beauty to the beach view. As we look ahead, expect snow to begin falling after midnight, although minimal accumulation is anticipated, with a new layer likely under an inch. Tonight\u2019s low will drop to around freezing, accompanied by gentle winds, which could create a more biting chill as the evening progresses.\n\nWith the holiday season in full swing and just days before Christmas, outdoor activities might be best kept to brief visits to enjoy the scenery, perhaps with a warm beverage in hand. Given the conditions, layering is recommended, with a good winter coat, hat, and gloves to keep the cold at bay. While the waves are relatively calm today, they may pick up slightly with the incoming weather. Overall, the late afternoon positions Evanston squarely in that classic winter ambiance, where one can appreciate the quiet beauty of the season, albeit with some discomfort from the chill of the air.",
