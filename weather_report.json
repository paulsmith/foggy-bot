    "weather_report": "An early morning in Evanston reveals a chilly scene, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s. The air is dense and damp, giving life to a thick fog that looms over the beach, obscuring visibility and lending a mysterious atmosphere. Winds are brisk and howling from the west, creating a sharp contrast against the stillness of the water, which may lead to choppy conditions on Lake Michigan.\n\nLooking ahead to the day, a shift is expected. The fog will likely dissipate before 9 a.m., making way for partly sunny skies as temperatures creep towards the high 30s by afternoon. However, as the day progresses, the temperature will begin to decline, ushering in a much colder night with lows around 19. Winds will remain fierce, gusting up to 45 mph, so the air will feel even colder than the thermometer suggests. \n\nIn terms of attire, it's advisable to bundle up in layers, including a warm coat, hat, and perhaps a scarf to shield against the biting wind. With the current season being winter, these conditions are typical for Evanston, prompting a recommendation for indoor activities. A visit to a local caf\u00e9 or cozy library might be enjoyable, as would a stroll along the path if you're prepared for the elements. Today is just another ordinary Tuesday in February, without any major holiday on the horizon.",
