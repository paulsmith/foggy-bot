    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds over Evanston, a gentle warmth lingers in the air with temperatures dipping from a comfortable low 50s to around the mid-40s, promoting an inviting yet slightly chilly environment. The atmosphere remains clear, providing a pleasant backdrop as a light breeze whispers from the west, making it ideal for an invigorating stroll. However, as night falls, the forecast brings a shift in the weather, with rain showers likely to arrive after 1 AM. A low around the mid-30s is predicted, with an increase in temperature overnight, hinting at a moist start to the next day.\n\nWave conditions at Lake Michigan may begin to stir as the day progresses, influenced by impending precipitation. The chance of light rain won\u2019t deter outdoor endeavors for much of the day, but a proper coat or warm layers will keep you cozy against the evening chill. While outdoor activities are still quite feasible with the current charm of the season, do consider your plans noting the pleasant yet soon-to-turn unpredictable conditions ahead. Today is unremarkable in terms of holidays or significant events, allowing a moment of normalcy amid winter.",
