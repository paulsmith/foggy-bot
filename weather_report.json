    "weather_report": "Current weather conditions in Evanston present a frigid scene, with temperatures in the low 20s accompanied by a piercing northwest wind, creating a noticeably brisk atmosphere. The air is thick with light snow and fog, contributing to a somewhat obscured view, particularly along the lakefront. As we look toward the upcoming hours, expect more snow overnight, with a chance of accumulation, though it remains minimal. The wind will shift slightly, maintaining that notable bluster, which will feel invigorating yet biting.\n\nAs the sun rises on Thursday, residents can anticipate a shift to mostly sunny skies, although high temperatures barely reach the low 20s before slightly dipping by afternoon. Despite the chilly air, the sun will offer a welcome reprieve from the bleakness of winter, but the strong winds will keep conditions feeling quite raw. Those venturing outside should dress warmly, opting for insulated layers and wind-resistant outerwear. Given the season, these temperatures align with typical winter conditions for the region, reaffirming the need for warmth and comfort. With the beauty of the lake transformed under a blanket of snow, a brisk walk along the shore might be a refreshing way to soak in the stark winter landscape, but staying bundled up is essential to enjoy the brisk air safely.",
