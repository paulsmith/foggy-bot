    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reflect a chilly morning, with temperatures in the mid to high 40s, accompanied by a damp coolness that makes for an uncomfortably humid atmosphere at this hour. The day begins under a blanket of clouds, with wind gusts stirring from the southwest, adding a brisk edge to the otherwise muted scenery near Lake Michigan. As we look ahead to today, expect partly sunny intervals to emerge by afternoon, though temperatures are poised to peak at around 50 before gradually waning. \n\nWaves along the shore may be lively due to the sustained winds, making this a time better suited for a cozy indoor activity rather than a seaside stroll. Light precipitation is anticipated, but nothing more than a trace, which might serve to keep the air feeling fresh, though possibly damp. It's advisable to dress warmly in layered clothing to combat the coolness, perhaps with a light jacket or sweater for later when temperatures dip again. Given that it is December\u2014typically a time for winter's chill to firmly establish itself\u2014these conditions are quite standard for the season in this region, although today might feel slightly more brisk due to the wind. As for activities, consider a warm cup of coffee or tea at a local caf\u00e9, a leisurely visit to nearby shops, or simply curling up at home with a good book\u2014perfect weather for indoor interests on this gray December day.",
