    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston are brisk and somewhat blustery, with a temperature hovering in the mid-40s. The air feels cool due to a strong southwesterly breeze, whipping at nearly 46 miles per hour, creating a lively atmosphere near the lakeshore, where anyone braving the outdoors will feel the chill in the air. The sky is currently partly cloudy, adding an intriguing depth to the night but no immediate threat of rain. \n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, the forecast calls for mostly sunny skies and a high in the low 50s, with temperatures gradually dropping to the mid-40s in the afternoon. It will be a day significantly more inviting than the night, with a gentler south-southwest breeze. This improvement in the weather presents ideal opportunities for outdoor activities, whether it's a leisurely stroll by the beach or perhaps enjoying a warm beverage at a local caf\u00e9 while taking in the views of Lake Michigan. Attire wise, layers will be essential\u2014think jackets and perhaps a cozy scarf to fend off the lingering coolness. Given that we are in December and the temperatures are typical for this region in late fall, one cannot help but appreciate the seasonal atmosphere that embraces Evanston this time of year.",
