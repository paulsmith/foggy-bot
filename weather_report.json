    "weather_report": "As the sun rises over Evanston, chilly conditions prevail with temperatures settling in the mid to upper 20s and a brisk northwest wind creating a biting chill in the air. Currently mostly cloudy, the evening brought little comfort, but residents can expect scattered snow showers later in the morning as the temperature struggles to reach the low 30s, only to hover near the mid-20s by afternoon. Gusty winds will add to the wintry atmosphere, making outdoor ventures feel notably colder.\n\nThe beach scene is quiet, the waves likely gentle, given the calm before the forecasted snowfall. While precipitation will remain light, any snow accumulation should be minimal, perhaps less than an inch. Dress warmly if heading outdoors, layering is essential to counter the cold and blustery conditions. Given that we're deep in December, these temperatures are typical for the season, but the lingering clouds may dampen the holiday spirit a bit. If you're contemplating activities, consider cozying up indoors with a warm beverage or engaging in holiday preparations as the weather invites a snug embrace rather than outdoor adventures.",
