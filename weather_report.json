    "weather_report": "As evening settles over Evanston, temperatures hover in the low 50s, providing a mildly crisp atmosphere as you step outside. Currently, it is mostly clear, with a gentle breeze whispering in from the west, making for a pleasant outdoor feel. However, the forecast holds a different story for tonight, as rain showers are expected to creep in after 1 a.m., with temperatures dipping to the mid-30s before rising slightly overnight. It's a classic transitional winter evening in the Midwest.\n\nWave conditions along the shores of Lake Michigan might stir as the rain approaches, potentially leading to choppy waters overnight. With a 60% chance of precipitation, it would be wise to prepare for wet weather. For those venturing out this evening, layer up\u2014perhaps a warm jacket and sturdy footwear will do the trick. Considering we are still in winter here, temperatures are running quite typical for this time of year. As we look ahead, indoor activities might be the best option, as the wet weather settles in and the chill sets in after dark. The day might not be a holiday, but it certainly invites a reflective indoor evening as we await the spring thaw in the days to come.",
