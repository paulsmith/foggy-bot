    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly scene, as light freezing drizzle and snow drift across the air, paired with a dense fog that thickens the atmosphere. The temperature hovers in the low 30s, creating a raw and biting chill, accentuated by a blustery wind from the southeast. As night sets in, there's a solid chance of accumulating snow, with projections indicating one to two inches could blanket the area, turning the landscape into a soft, wintry postcard. The ocean waves, perhaps not as fierce as during a storm, may see a gentle swell, kissed by the frosty breeze.\n\nLooking ahead to the day, expect persistent snow showers accompanied by cloudy skies, with temperatures barely climbing to the mid-30s before they retreat again. The wind, sometimes howling with gusts up to 40 mph, will keep the air feeling even colder. Attire should be warm and layered, with a heavy jacket, gloves, and insulated boots highly advisable for anyone venturing outdoors. While these conditions may seem less than welcoming, it\u2019s a perfect afternoon for sipping hot cocoa indoors or gathering with friends to celebrate the season of festivities\u2014though it is not a national holiday, the spirit of the season is certainly in the air.",
