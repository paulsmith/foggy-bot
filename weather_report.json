    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a chilly, brisk evening with temperatures hovering in the low 30s. A fierce wind is sweeping in from the southwest, creating a sharp bite to the air that underscores the need for warm clothing. The sky remains clear at this hour, but as darkness envelops the shore, the majestic Lake Michigan seems to take on a serene, calm demeanor, though the wind does churn the water slightly.\n\nLooking ahead, the weather forecast for tonight indicates mostly cloudy skies with a low in the mid-20s, while tomorrow promises a high in the low 40s under similar cloud cover. Gusty winds are expected to persist, making it crucial to prepare for blustery conditions throughout the day. There is no rain on the horizon, so outdoor plans can proceed without the threat of precipitation. Given the season and the chilling temperatures typical of early December in the Midwest, residents are advised to don warm layers, perhaps a hat and scarf, if venturing outside. Ideal activities may include a brisk walk along the beach or a cozy evening indoors, relishing the warmth with family or friends, especially as the holiday season approaches.",
