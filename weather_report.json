    "weather_report": "This evening in Evanston, conditions are chilly, with temperatures in the mid-30s, complemented by a persistent cloud cover that casts a gray hue over the shoreline. A steady breeze from the northwest adds an unsettled chill to the air, contributing to a rather brisk atmosphere as the wind stirs the waters of Lake Michigan, creating gently rolling waves. While there isn't any precipitation currently observed, the outlook remains foreboding with expectations of temperatures dipping further tonight.\n\nLooking ahead, the weather tomorrow is set to maintain its cloudy demeanor, with a high struggling to reach the upper 30s and a gusty north wind continuing to sweep through. It's a rather wintry scene typical for this time of year in the Midwest, where such cool weather reflects the deepening winter season. Layers are advisable, ideally a warm coat along with a scarf to stave off the cold as you enjoy the brisk air. Although outdoor activities should be approached judiciously given the conditions, a leisurely stroll along the beach could offer a stark yet beautiful winter vista. Keep in mind that tomorrow is not marked by any major holiday, but the festive spirit looms large as we approach the Christmas season.",
