    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston paint a chilly picture, typical of late November, with temperatures lingering in the mid-30s and a damp atmosphere that enhances the coolness of the air. The skies are overcast, draping a gray blanket over the landscape, while a gentle yet persistent breeze whispers off Lake Michigan, giving the environment an invigorating but slightly uncomfortable feel. Visibility may be reduced due to the patchy fog anticipated overnight, which could linger into the early morning hours, making the early hours feel more isolating.\n\nLooking ahead at the forecast for the day, expect those murky conditions to ease up by mid-morning, giving way to partly sunny skies that could lift spirits and temperatures into the upper 40s. The waves on the lake remain modest, making it less than ideal for any vigorous water activities, but still inviting for those who enjoy a brisk stroll along the shore, bundled up in warm layers. A light jacket paired with a scarf will suffice to fend off the chill, particularly as a gentle southerly breeze starts to flow. While no significant precipitation is expected in the short term, the atmosphere still carries a hint of moisture that could prompt a light drizzle, especially before noon. As this is a weekend with no major holiday on the calendar, it offers a perfect opportunity for outdoor family activities or a quiet day by the water, should one wish to embrace the tranquility of the season.",
