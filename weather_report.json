    "weather_report": "This morning in Evanston, the atmosphere is a bit blustery as temperatures hover in the low 60s, creating a somewhat cool ambiance that feels heavier due to the overcast skies and increased moisture in the air. The winds are howling from the south-southwest, contributing to a restless feeling along the beach as waves lap against the shore. Today\u2019s weather calls for mostly cloudy conditions with a chance of rain showers earlier in the day, though these should clear up somewhat as we progress into the afternoon. Expect a high nearing 60 before temperatures dip slightly to the mid-50s later on.\n\nAs the sun sets tonight, a few sprinkles may emerge around 3 AM, but overall, the evening will be primarily cloudy with temperatures cooling down to the low 40s. Those venturing outdoors should consider wearing layers to stay warm, especially with the brisk winds and potential for a light jacket to keep comfortable. While the atmosphere might not lend itself to beach lounging, it could be an ideal day for a brisk walk along the shore or enjoying the cozy confines of a local caf\u00e9. This time of year is typical for Evanston, where the chill signifies the approach of winter, making these autumn days a fleeting treasure.",
