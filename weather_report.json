    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the day greets us with a chill, where temperatures hover in the mid-30s, accentuated by a brisk wind that sweeps in from the west, lending a fierce edge to the atmosphere. The sky is overcast, presenting a thick blanket of clouds overhead, hinting at the potential for rain and snow showers later in the afternoon. As the day progresses, temperatures are expected to drop further, accompanied by gusts that could reach up to 50 miles per hour, making it feel much colder, possibly dipping into single digits with wind chill.\n\nFor this evening, scattered snow showers are anticipated, but little accumulation is predicted. The overall appearance outside is rather bleak, with the gray sky reflecting off the lake's surface in muted tones. Those venturing out should bundle up warmly, perhaps opting for insulated layers, a heavy coat, and a warm hat to combat the biting chill. Beach activities are not advisable given the wind and the looming precipitation; instead, a cozy afternoon indoors would be more appropriate, perhaps accompanied by a warm drink. This report comes on an ordinary December day, not marked by any special holiday, but it certainly captures the heart of a typical winter in this part of the Midwest, where such frigid conditions are to be expected in early December.",
