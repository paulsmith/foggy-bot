    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a chilly and brisk evening, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s. The air is thickened by a light cloud cover, creating a wintry atmosphere accentuated by a fierce westerly wind sweeping across Lake Michigan. As night falls, the scene at the beach remains somewhat somber yet captivating, inviting contemplative moments by the shoreline. Tonight, expect the possibility of snow showers, primarily before midnight, with temperatures dipping further to around 27 degrees. \n\nLooking ahead to Wednesday, conditions will remain mostly cloudy, with a high near 31 in the morning but expected to drop to the low 20s by afternoon. Frequent gusts can be anticipated, further invigorating the chilly air, as new snow accumulation may reach less than half an inch\u2014a fitting capstone to this December day. The atmosphere calls for layered attire: warm coats, hats, and gloves to stave off the biting chill. Given the wintry conditions and the time of year, outdoor festivities may be limited, leaving indoor pursuits or cozy gatherings as prudent choices. As we embrace the holiday season, stay warm and find joy in the winter's embrace.",
