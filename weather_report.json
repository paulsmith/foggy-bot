    "weather_report": "In Evanston, current conditions reflect a brisk winter chill, with temperatures hovering in the mid 20s and a strong, gusty breeze from the south. The air is thick with clouds, setting the stage for a potentially wintry afternoon. Looking ahead, today\u2019s forecast suggests the possibility of some snow in the early afternoon, transitioning into a mix of rain and snow as temperatures rise toward the high 30s. While the chance of precipitation sits at a noteworthy 60%, any new snow accumulation is expected to be minimal.\n\nThis combination of cooling winds and overcast skies delivers a rather gloomy appearance, fitting for a typical December day on the shores of Lake Michigan. The waves may appear moderate owing to the wind, but there likely won't be any substantial surf conditions to contend with. Given the cool temperatures and threat of mixed precipitation, layering up is advisable; a warm coat, gloves, and a scarf will be necessary to fend off the chill. Overall, these winter temperatures align with expectations for this time of year in the Midwest, marking the season\u2019s presence unmistakably. As for activities, the weather may not be ideal for extensive outdoor adventures, but enjoying a warm drink from a nearby caf\u00e9 or taking a brisk walk to relish the seasonal atmosphere are certainly viable options. Notably, today is not a holiday, but with winter upon us, many will soon be looking forward to the festive celebrations ahead.",
