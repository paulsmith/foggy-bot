    "weather_report": "Evanston's current winter scene is marked by chilly, overcast conditions with temperatures resting in the mid-20s. The atmosphere feels brisk, with the still air contributing to a quiet, somewhat somber ambiance typical of January's embrace. Looking ahead, the overnight forecast suggests it will remain mostly cloudy, dipping to the low 20s, but tomorrow the sun will break through, promising a mild day leading into the upper 30s. The expected west-southwest winds will bring a breezy kick, making it feel slightly cooler, especially along the lakefront where waves could be refreshingly lively.\n\nWith no immediate precipitation in sight, the beach remains a tranquil space for a reflective stroll or a brisk run, albeit with warm layers strongly advised to stave off the chill. As we move through this winter season, Evanston\u2019s temperatures are consistent with what's typically expected for this time of year, maintaining a crispness that invites cozy indoor activities or short excursions outdoors. Keep an eye out for a welcome uptick in brightness tomorrow, ideal for those eager to shake off winter's grasp.",
