    "weather_report": "This morning in Evanston, the air is crisp and cool, currently holding in the upper 40s, with an invigorating breeze from the south. The atmosphere carries a slight chill that enhances the feeling of early winter. As the day unfolds, expect mostly cloudy skies with just a touch of sun peeking through, and a high reaching into the upper 50s. Winds will be gentle to moderate, creating a pleasant sound against the backdrop of Lake Michigan\u2019s waves, though they may stir up a bit of a chop on the water surface.\n\nPrecipitation is unlikely today, with only a slight chance of brief rain showers. Tonight, temperatures are projected to dip into the low 40s, bringing a clearer sky and transitioning the day into a cool evening. Dressing in layers would be wise; a light jacket should suffice for daytime activities while an additional layer may be needed as the sun sets. Given the current season and region, these temperatures are typical for mid-November, highlighting the gradual shift toward winter. For those eager to enjoy the outdoors, a stroll along the beach could be refreshing, though a brisk walk may be preferable to truly embrace the invigorating conditions.",
