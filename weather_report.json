    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a brisk and chilly atmosphere, with temperatures hovering in the mid-20s and the air feeling fresh under the cloudy sky. The wind is quite fierce, gusting in from the northwest, creating a biting chill that makes outdoor ventures less inviting. Overnight, intermittent snow showers are expected, though accumulation looks minimal with just a modest chance of precipitation. As day breaks, the snow should taper off, giving way to some fleeting glimpses of sun, yet temperatures will remain cool, hovering around the mid-20s throughout the day, cooling further by afternoon.\n\nThe sight of Lake Michigan may be captivating but with the cold winds and potential for snow, a layered approach to attire is advisable\u2014think warm coats, hats, and gloves to fend off the brisk air. Wave conditions could be moderate, likely stirred up by the gusty winds, making it a less-than-ideal day for those wishing to enjoy the lakefront. While it may not be the prettiest day for a stroll on the beach, bringing a hot beverage along could make for a rejuvenating experience at the water\u2019s edge. As we move into early December, this weather is typical for the region, evoking the season\u2019s wintry charm. Today may not celebrate a holiday, but the mood of winter is certainly upon us, inviting quiet reflections as the landscape transforms under gray skies.",
