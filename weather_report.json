    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently experiencing cool conditions with temperatures hovering in the low 50s, accompanied by a gentle humidity that adds a slight dampness to the air. The skies are mostly clouded, casting a muted light over the beach and Lake Michigan. Winds are picking up, blowing from the southeast at a brisk pace, giving a blustery feel to the night. As we look ahead to Sunday, rain showers are anticipated later in the day, especially after noon, with temperatures expected to reach a high near 60, but may drop slightly in the afternoon as the precipitation rolls in.\n\nThe evening\u2019s appearance is somewhat dreary, with overcast skies and potential rain casting a shadow over outdoor plans. Wave conditions may become choppier as the wind persists, possibly creating a somewhat turbulent surface on the lake. Given the forecast and evening chill, layering up with a warm jacket is recommended, especially if venturing out before the rain arrives. Considering the season, the weather reflects typical autumnal conditions in the Midwest, where brisk air beckons cozy indoor activities or perhaps a stroll along the beach to appreciate the power of the lake. With no holidays on the horizon, those looking for a quiet evening may find solace in a warm drink and a good book as the rain sets in subtly later on.",
