    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois, reveal a cool and crisp atmosphere as the temperature rests in the mid 30s, complemented by a gentle breeze. The area is cloaked under a veil of mostly cloudy skies, which, along with the brisk winds, imparts a somewhat wintry feel to the scene. Looking ahead, the overnight hours may bring the slightest chance of snow, but any accumulation is expected to be negligible as temperatures settle near the freezing mark. By Wednesday, the weather will transition to a more moderate phase with an anticipated high in the mid 40s, the clouds remaining a prominent feature throughout the day.\n\nAs for the beach and Lake Michigan, wave conditions should generally be calm, though visitors might notice a gentle lapping against the shore under the current cloudy conditions. For those braving the elements, dressing in layers is recommended to combat the chilly air. This time of year typically brings lower temperatures, making the current setup fairly representative of late November in this region. While outdoor activities might be limited due to the brisk temperatures, it\u2019s a good time for reflective walks along the lakefront or perhaps an indoor visit to a nearby caf\u00e9 to enjoy a warm beverage.",
