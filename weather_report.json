    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reflect a typical winter's day, with temperatures hovering in the low teens and a brisk, gusty wind sweeping across the landscape. As you venture out, you'll feel the sharp sting of wind chill, which can plunge to a biting -3 degrees. The air is clear for now, promising a sunny afternoon that will see a slight drop in temperature, settling near 10 degrees. The shoreline along Lake Michigan may have some modest waves today, lending the beach a dynamic presence, though conditions remain calm in terms of precipitation, with no significant moisture expected.\n\nAs day turns to night, expect a shift towards mostly cloudy skies, with temperatures dipping further to around 3 degrees and a chilly wind that may occasionally howl. In this wintry season, such temperatures are in line with what is typical for February in the Midwest. For anyone venturing outdoors, especially near the water, layered attire including a heavy coat, hat, and gloves will be essential to ward off the cold. Given the conditions and the time of year, a brisk walk along the lakefront could be a refreshing option; however, outdoor activities should be optimized for warmth and comfort.",
