    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the night air is dense with humidity, presenting a sultry feel underscored by light rain and mist hanging low. Currently, temperatures hover in the low 60s, coupled with a fierce breeze sweeping in from the south, causing trees to sway and rippling the surface of Lake Michigan. As we look ahead, the forecast warns of showers and thunderstorms overnight, with the possibility of heavy downpours\u2014rainfall could reach up to an inch. The likelihood of precipitation stands at a remarkable 100%, ensuring a wet night ahead. Tomorrow promises more of the same; the clouds will linger, and while temperatures may inch towards the mid-60s, expect a drop in the afternoon. Wind gusts could intensify, making it feel even chillier.\n\nGiven these conditions, the atmosphere is far from pleasant, with outdoor activities likely hindered by rain and wind. Waves will likely be choppy along the shoreline, punctuated by gusty winds, making it less than ideal for any water-related pursuits. Tonight and well into tomorrow, layering up will be essential; a waterproof jacket and sturdy shoes are advisable for anyone venturing outside. As we settle into November, the weather reflects the typical shift toward cooler, wetter days, a signature of the season in this part of the Midwest. With the current conditions dominating the night sky, cozying up indoors with a good book or a movie might be the best course of action during this damp and blustery spell.",
