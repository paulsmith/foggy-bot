    "weather_report": "Evanston is waking up to a chilly December morning with temperatures hovering in the mid-teens. The air feels crisp, with substantial wind that adds a bite to the current conditions, making it feel notably colder. As for visibility, the day is expected to remain partly cloudy, casting a subtle brightness over the landscape, although the chilly breeze from the west-northwest might deter those unprepared for the cold.\n\nLooking ahead, the day promises to bring partly sunny skies with a high in the low 30s. Wind gusts could heighten as the afternoon unfolds, making it feel brisk and invigorating, perhaps ideal for bundled-up outings rather than lingering outdoors without proper attire. While there\u2019s no expected precipitation, the cool winter air suggests that the lake will remain quite still, presenting gentle wave conditions along the shore. Given the seasonal chill, warm layers are necessary, including hats and gloves to keep warm when stepping outside. Overall, it\u2019s a typical winter day for Evanston, and those who embrace the crispness might enjoy a brisk walk along the beach or a warm cup of coffee at a local caf\u00e9 while watching the clouds drift by.",
