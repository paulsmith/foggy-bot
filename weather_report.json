    "weather_report": "Current weather in Evanston, Illinois paints a chilly scene with temperatures hovering in the mid 20s and a fierce northwesterly wind creating a biting wind chill. The air feels crisp as snow showers are likely to roll in overnight, with an 80% chance of precipitation promising 1 to 2 inches of accumulation. Looking ahead, Sunday brings a continuation of cloudy skies, with temperatures peaking around the upper 20s before taking a dive to the low 20s by the afternoon. Winds will remain strong, contributing to the blustery feel.\n\nAs observers venture outdoors, the wintry landscape may present an uninviting appearance, especially with the potential for new snow and a backdrop of gray skies. Wave conditions at the beach along Lake Michigan could create a formidable scene, with choppy waters stirred by the gusty winds. Layering up is essential; a warm coat, gloves, and perhaps a hat will be wise choices to ward off the chill. Given the winter season, these temperatures align well with what is typical for mid-February in the Midwest. Conditions call for indoor pursuits, but hardy souls might brave the outdoors, enjoying winter activities or simply savoring the stark beauty of the lake's winter visage.",
