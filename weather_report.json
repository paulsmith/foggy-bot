    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston indicate a rather gloomy afternoon, with temperatures hovering in the low 50s and a stubborn blanket of clouds overhead. The air feels damp and cool, intensified by a brisk northwest wind that is stirring up some wave activity on Lake Michigan. This evening, expect continued cloud cover as temperatures dip to a comfortable low in the upper 40s, with winds calming slightly but still providing a noticeable chill.\n\nAs for the rest of the day, it looks like a slightly blustery and overcast situation will prevail, making outdoor activities less enticing. Those venturing out should bundle up with layers, perhaps including a warm jacket and scarf, to stay cozy against the cool and breezy conditions. The wave conditions on the lake are moderately active, which may be of interest to surfers or those looking to enjoy a brisk beach walk. Given it's mid-November, temperatures are typical for the season\u2014evoking that quintessential late fall feel where the leaves have mostly turned and the chill is settling in. While today is not marked by any significant festivities or holidays, it presents a perfect opportunity to enjoy the tranquility of nature or indulge in a cozy cafe visit.",
