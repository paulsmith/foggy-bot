    "weather_report": "As night settles over Evanston, current conditions reveal a chilly atmosphere with temperatures dipping into the low 40s. The air feels crisp, accentuated by a brisk north wind adding an invigorating edge to the evening. Cloud cover blankets the sky, and the welling humidity gives the air a noticeably damp quality\u2014a sharp contrast to the clear, bright days of summer. Looking ahead, there\u2019s a chance of rain showers before dawn. The mercury is expected to tumble overnight, reaching a low near the freezing mark, with a slight rise as the night progresses.\n\nThanksgiving Day will greet residents with mostly sunny skies, though temperatures are projected to linger in the mid-30s throughout the afternoon, accompanied by a gentle northwest breeze that will occasionally gust up to 25 mph. While the ocean might beckon with their roiling waves, they could present an impetuous welcome as the wind churns the surface; beachcombers should exercise caution if venturing near the water. Given the cool air, layered clothing is advisable, perhaps a warm coat, a sturdy hat, and gloves. The current temperatures align with the seasonal expectations typical for late November in the Midwest, just a reminder that winter's chill is right around the corner. With the holiday upon us, perhaps gatherings with friends and family indoors might be the day\u2019s highlight, although a brisk walk along the lakeshore could also invigorate the spirit before the festivities commence.",
