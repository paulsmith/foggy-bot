    "weather_report": "This morning in Evanston, the weather is crisp, with temperatures hovering in the low 50s. The air is somewhat humid, giving a slight chill, especially with the robust winds blowing fiercely from the northwest. The sky is mostly clear, revealing deep blue expanses, which promise a delightful day ahead. As we look forward, expect a sunny afternoon with temperatures climbing near the upper 50s, settling back down into the mid 40s tonight under a clear starry sky.\n\nThe beach scene is serene, inviting for a stroll along the shore, though those planning to venture out should consider warm attire to counter the cool breeze. Wind-driven waves may have a refreshing but gentle roll, perfect for contemplation but perhaps not quite robust enough for extensive water activities. With November well underway, the temperatures are typical for this time of year in the Midwest, offering a striking transition from the brilliance of autumn to the impending chill of winter. Ideal for an invigorating walk or perhaps visiting local shops and caf\u00e9s that capture the essence of this charming lakeside town, the day holds promise for those seeking both activity and tranquility in the heart of autumn.",
