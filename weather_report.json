    "weather_report": "Evanston wakes up to a brisk, chilly morning, with temperatures hovering in the mid-30s, creating a fresh atmosphere that's invigorating yet biting. The clouds drape the sky in a thick gray blanket, characteristic of an unsettled day, while a gentle breeze whispers from the east-southeast, gently pushing the chilly air around. As we move through the day, expect these clouds to linger, accompanying highs near the mid-40s. While temperatures may briefly dip in the afternoon, the air may feel cooler as a slight chance of rain and snow showers materializes later this evening, adding a touch of moisture to the already damp surroundings.\n\nWith wave conditions expected to remain fairly shallow, the beach may not invite swimmers today, but the overcast ambience offers a dramatic view of Lake Michigan, perfect for a contemplative stroll along the shore. Dressing warmly in layers will ensure comfort against the cool temperatures; winter jackets, scarves, and hats will be wise choices as we navigate this late November day. This time of year often brings such chill, and today\u2019s conditions are quite typical for the region. Given that it's not a holiday, local residents might find an afternoon at a cozy caf\u00e9 or an exploration of indoor markets to be the best way to enjoy the day while staying snug.",
