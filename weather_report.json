    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a rather brisk scene, with temperatures in the low 40s and a gently rising trend expected overnight. The air feels cool and somewhat refreshing, ideal for those who enjoy the briskness of late fall evenings. Winds are noticeably strong, creating a wild atmosphere along the coast of Lake Michigan, especially as they whip across open spaces. The sky is mostly cloudy, allowing some light to filter through but ultimately giving way to a muted palette typical of early winter.\n\nLooking ahead, tonight promises to be partly cloudy, with temperatures dipping to the mid to high 30s before warming slightly later in the night. Tomorrow, a sunny respite is expected, ushering in a pleasant day with highs nearing the mid 50s. This gradual transition hints at more seasonal light, though winds may remain spirited. Given the wave conditions along the lakefront, expect choppy surf as those gusty winds continue, which could make for an enjoyable sight for those viewing from the shore. As we move deeper into December, these temperatures fall within a typical range for the season, invoking opportunities for cozy attire\u2014perhaps a warm jacket and sturdy footwear would be just right. For those inclined to venture out, tomorrow\u2019s forecast allows for outdoor strolls or a warm cup of coffee while watching the lake dance under the sun.",
