    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current conditions reflect a damp and overcast atmosphere, with the temperature settled in the mid 60s, accompanied by a high humidity that contributes to a muggy feel. As rain lightly falls, the south wind howls at nearly 50 mph, creating a blustery scene by Lake Michigan, where waves churn restlessly against the shore. With an 80% chance of continued rain through the night, expect the cloudy skies to usher in persistent showers, and temperatures to settle to the low 60s.\n\nLooking ahead to Tuesday, rain showers will dominate, and the mercury will hover in the mid 60s before gradually slipping to the low 60s by afternoon. Strong winds from the south-southwest, gusting up to 45 mph, will only add to the wild conditions. Given this weather, it\u2019s advisable to dress warmly in waterproof attire, perhaps a sturdy jacket and reliable footwear, as you might encounter slick surfaces and blustery winds. The current temperatures are typical for November in this region, signaling the transition into the chillier months. Outdoor activities might be limited, but this weather could be perfect for cozying up indoors with a good book or enjoying the comforting ambiance of a local caf\u00e9, watching the rain painted against the windows.",
