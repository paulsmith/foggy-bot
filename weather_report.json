    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a brisk environment, with temperatures hovering in the upper 40s and a gentle chill in the air, creating a perfectly cool atmosphere that invites a cozy night in. As the evening unfolds, intermittent clouds will dominate the skyline, with an occasional chance of rain showers expected before the dawn breaks. The winds are lively, blowing from the west-northwest at a brisk pace, adding a refreshing character to the air. \n\nLooking ahead to Wednesday, the day's forecast brings a blend of cloud cover with a likelihood of rain tapering off through the morning, shifting to scattered showers by afternoon. Temperatures are anticipated to peak in the upper 40s before cascading back to the low 40s, a reminder of the late autumn chill settling in. With gusty winds making waves on Lake Michigan, the shoreline may be a spot to watch those frothy crests rather than wade into the water. Dress warmly if venturing out, layering for the cooler afternoon is wise given the drop in temperatures and potential for wet conditions. Considering the season, these temperatures align with typical late November norms, setting the stage for indoor activities or a brisk stroll along the beach, though caution is warranted due to the uncertain weather.",
