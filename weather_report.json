    "weather_report": "As the sun rises over Evanston this morning, the air is crisp and cool, registering in the mid-20s. A gentle breeze flows from the southwest at a notable clip, creating a brisk atmosphere. The current weather presents a partly cloudy sky, setting a tranquil backdrop as residents prepare for the day. With no precipitation expected, this mid-winter morning offers a refreshing clarity typical for this time of year.\n\nLooking ahead, the day will gradually warm to the low 40s, with partly sunny skies promising a pleasant afternoon. The winds will ease somewhat, making for a more comfortable outdoor experience. As night falls, temperatures will dip to the mid-30s, with increasing cloud cover and rising temperatures overnight. Given the season, the current conditions are in line with expectations for late February in the Midwest, where robust winter holds sway. \n\nFor those venturing outside, layered attire is advisable\u2014think warm coats, hats, and gloves, with perhaps a lighter layer underneath for the afternoon sun. Wave conditions at nearby Lake Michigan may be moderate, presenting opportunities for brisk beach walks but not ideal for water sports, given the winter chill. Engaging in leisurely strolls along the shore or visiting local cafes sounds just right for today\u2019s weather, allowing for a pleasant refuge from the strong winds and chilly temps.",
