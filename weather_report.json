    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the current weather presents a chilly scene, with temperatures in the mid 30s paired with a brisk and gusty wind, creating a distinctly crisp atmosphere. While partly cloudy skies dominate now, the day anticipates scattered rain and snow showers later, particularly after 3 PM, with an overall high struggling to reach the upper 30s. Wind gusts may whip around at speeds up to 50 mph, heightening the chill and bringing wind chill values down to the low single digits by tonight, when temperatures will drop to around 14, making it feel like an icy -4.\n\nVisually, the beach appears gray and moody under overcast skies, suggesting an unpleasant experience for those outdoors. The wave conditions along Lake Michigan could be somewhat choppy due to the strong winds, and with these precipitation forecasts, it may be wise to stay indoors for comfort. For the brave souls venturing out, layered attire is essential; a warm coat, gloves, and a hat are recommended to combat the biting cold. Amidst the winter season, these temperatures align with typical expectations for early December in the Midwest. While outdoor activities may be limited today, indoor pursuits or cozy gatherings would certainly be more inviting during this blustery day as we edge closer to the festive holiday season.",
