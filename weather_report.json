    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois reflect a chilly and cloudy afternoon, with temperatures hovering in the low 40s. A gentle breeze from the east adds a touch of coolness to the air, creating a brisk feeling that resonates with the dampness typical of late November. The clouds loom thick, casting a muted gray over the landscape, while the still waters of Lake Michigan present a tranquil scene with only a few gentle ripples.\n\nLooking ahead, the forecast indicates a continuation of mostly cloudy skies this afternoon, with temperatures expected to slightly dip as we move into the evening. The potential for scattered rain showers looms later tonight, particularly between 9 PM and 3 AM, contributing to the damp atmosphere and bringing a low down to the low 30s overnight. The chance of precipitation sits around 40%. For those out and about, layering up with a warm coat, scarf, and gloves is advisable to combat the chill. Generally, this weather aligns with what one would expect in the early winter months in the Midwest, where cooler temperatures and overcast skies frequently characterize the season. Given these conditions, a stroll along the beach may still offer a refreshing escape, but one might also enjoy cozying up indoors with a warm drink or catching up on indoor hobbies.",
