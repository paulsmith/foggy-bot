    "weather_report": "Conditions in Evanston are currently on the chilly side, with temperatures hovering in the low 50s. The atmosphere is thick and heavy, embodying that characteristic damp chill that feels more pronounced under cloudy skies. There\u2019s a gentle breeze from the south, creating an added layer of briskness that could make outdoor conditions feel even cooler. As night stretches on, expect some scattered rain showers to emerge, potentially bringing about light drizzles that could persist into the early morning hours. \n\nLooking ahead to Monday, the day promises more of the same, with areas of drizzle lingering amidst overcast clouds throughout the morning and into the afternoon. The temperatures will gradually drop, reaching highs near the low 50s before retreating into the mid-40s as the day progresses. Water conditions along Lake Michigan may be a bit choppy but manageable, with waves responding to the gusty winds that could pick up throughout the day. Considering all this, a warm jacket and waterproof footwear would be wise attire for anyone planning to venture outdoors. While it might not be the most inviting weather for leisure activities, a brisk walk near the shoreline could still be refreshing, albeit with the need for layers to keep comfortable. This day falls outside major holiday celebrations, offering a quiet backdrop typical of late November in the Midwest.",
