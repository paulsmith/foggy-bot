    "weather_report": "As morning breaks over Evanston, the air is crisp and cool, with current temperatures in the low 20s and a gentle but persistent breeze sweeping through, making it feel a touch chillier. The sky reveals its character as mostly cloudy today, but the forecast promises a shift towards clearer skies as the sun makes its way overhead. Highs are expected to drift toward the low 30s this afternoon, a welcome improvement from the frigid start. The wind carries with it the scent of Lake Michigan, strong enough to create a slight chop on the water, but nothing too severe for seasoned beachgoers or brisk morning walkers.\n\nTonight, the clouds will linger, offering a low that hovers around the mid-20s and, intriguingly, a rise in temperature as the night progresses. Those venturing outside will find warm layers advisable, perhaps a cozy jacket to cut through the coolness, alongside hats and gloves to shield against the still-biting wind. This time of year is typical for the region, as winter settles in firmly, and the chill in the air is a reminder that holiday gatherings are just around the corner. With daytime temperatures rising and a festive spirit mounting in the air, outdoor strolls along the beach or visits to local cafes are ideal for embracing the early December charm.",
