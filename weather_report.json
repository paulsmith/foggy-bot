    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois reveal a chilly atmosphere with a temperature in the low 40s, accompanied by a dampness that adds to the coolness of the evening. The air is thick and almost heavy, as clouds blanket the sky, while a steady breeze blows from the south, adding a sharpness to the air. As we look ahead to tonight, patchy fog is expected to make its appearance after midnight, creating a shroud over the mostly cloudy canvas of the night. The temperature will gradually drop to around the mid-30s, setting the stage for a brisk start to Monday.\n\nTomorrow, residents can anticipate a continuation of the mostly cloudy theme, with patchy fog lingering in the morning hours. The temperature is predicted to rise during the day to nearly the mid-40s, only to fall again as the afternoon progresses, ushering in the cooler evening chill. Wave conditions along Lake Michigan will likely be moderate, reflecting the gusty winds expected throughout the day. For those venturing outdoors, it is advisable to wear a layered ensemble, including a warm coat to fend off the evening chill, perhaps accessorized with a scarf and gloves. Although we find ourselves in winter's embrace, these temperatures are fairly typical for this season in the Midwest. As far as outdoor activities go, this evening might not be ideal for a long promenade by the beach, but a cozy gathering indoors or a short stroll to enjoy the crisp, fresh air could be a pleasant alternative.",
