    "weather_report": "As we find ourselves in the heart of a chilly December night in Evanston, the air is notably crisp with the temperature lingering in the low 20s, accompanied by a comforting cloak of moisture that softens the bite of the cold. A gentle breeze whispers from the west-northwest, making this evening feel a touch more brisk as the sky maintains a mostly clear demeanor, offering glimpses of celestial light. \n\nLooking ahead, we anticipate a transition into mostly cloudy skies overnight with temperatures dipping slightly; projected to settle near 19 degrees. Tomorrow's forecast holds a hint of possible snow showers, adding a whimsical note to what will otherwise be a predominantly overcast day, with highs approaching the upper 20s. While the beaches along Lake Michigan will not see much in the way of wave action, the tranquil surface could serve as a serene sight as winter settles in. Given the temperature and expected conditions, it's advisable to dress warmly with layers, including scarves and gloves, to enjoy any brief outdoor excursions. Though today isn't a holiday celebration, the seasonal chill certainly sets a festive tone leading into the upcoming week.",
