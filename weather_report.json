    "weather_report": "Currently in Evanston, the scene is a combination of cool temperatures and high humidity, creating a brisk and somewhat uncomfortable atmosphere. The temperature hovers in the upper 40s, and the air feels heavy with moisture, suggestive of impending drizzle that may make the air feel even chillier. Right now, the wind is howling from the northwest, sweeping across Lake Michigan and adding to the sense of urgency in the air. The sky is cloaked in clouds, giving little promise of a bright dawn ahead.\n\nAs we look toward Friday, expect a continuation of cloudy skies with temperatures reaching the low 50s. The slight chance of drizzle, particularly early on, may create a rather dreary mood throughout the day. While wave conditions at the beach are likely rough, with choppy waters reflecting the gusty winds, outdoor activities along the shore may be less appealing. Dress warmly in layers, opting for a sturdy jacket and waterproof shoes to navigate any slick spots from the drizzle. Given that it is mid-November, these temperatures are quite typical for this time of year in the Midwest, although the dampness gives it a chill that may require a bit more preparation for comfort. With no major holidays on the horizon, it might be best to reserve outdoor plans for another day when the skies may clear and the sun can make an appearance.",
