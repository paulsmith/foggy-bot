    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the atmosphere is decidedly cool and slightly blustery, with the current temperature hovering in the low 50s and a notable breeze stirring up the outdoor scene. The sky remains mostly cloudy, casting a muted light over Lake Michigan, while wind gusts reach a fierce pace, creating notable wave conditions on the shoreline. As the afternoon progresses, temperatures are expected to dip further, settling around the mid-40s by the time the sun gives way to the evening. Tonight, expect a dip to the mid-30s under partly cloudy skies, with a gentler breeze easing to around 10 to 20 miles per hour.\n\nOverall, the day presents a somewhat dreary yet crisp ambiance, ideal for bundling up in layers\u2014think warm coats, hats, and scarves\u2014as the bite in the air can be felt. The seas may be choppy, deterring typical beach activities, but a brisk walk along the shore could offer a refreshing escape. With the holiday season around the corner, this chilly December day invites introspection and cozy indoor pursuits, perhaps a warm drink or a gathering with friends. Today is a reminder that winter is settling in, typical for this season in the Midwest, as we edge closer to the heart of December.",
