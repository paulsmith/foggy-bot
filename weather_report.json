    "weather_report": "Currently, Evanston feels quite chilly, with temperatures in the low 10s and a breeze that's more biting than merely brisk, creating a wind chill effect that makes it seem even colder. The sky wears a cloak of mostly cloud, hinting at the possibility of intermittent snow showers as night approaches, making everything appear somewhat gloomy. Tonight is expected to bring a slight chance of snow with temperatures dipping to the low single digits, so the landscape may soon be dusted in a fine layer of white.\n\nAs the week unfolds, tomorrow morning offers a fleeting chance of snow before transitioning to mostly sunny skies. The day will see a high near the mid 20s, although the wind will remain a noticeable factor, gusting at times and ensuring that a warm jacket is an absolute necessity. Wave conditions on Lake Michigan are likely to be moderate, with the choppy waters reflecting the gustiness of the winds. Given the weather's chill, bundled clothing is strongly recommended for anyone looking to venture outdoors, while the shore may provide a stark but serene beauty best appreciated from a sheltered viewpoint. Though not a holiday today, the cold certainly beckons for cozy indoor activities or a brisk walk for the hearty souls willing to brave the elements.",
