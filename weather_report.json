    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Evanston, the air is marked by a cool, brisk sensation, with temperatures settled in the low 40s and a sense of heaviness from the humidity that hovers around 70%. Although it\u2019s mostly cloudy, the landscape appears tranquil, with a gentle breeze whispering off Lake Michigan, causing occasional ripples on the surface. For the day ahead, the forecast turns towards a greater likelihood of precipitation, particularly after 5 PM, with a 30% chance of rain, and temperatures expected to rise to near 54 degrees. \n\nThose venturing outdoors may find the atmosphere somewhat dreary, especially as rain is predicted to sweep in tonight with a 100% chance of showers and a likelihood of half an inch or more of rainfall. The waves on the lake are likely to echo the wind's intensity, creating a slightly lively scene along the shore. Given the chilliness in the air and the impending rain, layered clothing is advised, including a water-resistant outer layer to stay comfortable and dry. While the current conditions bring a touch of unsettledness typical for mid-November, residents might consider activities like cozying up indoors with a book or visiting local cafes, as the holiday season approaches with Thanksgiving just around the corner.",
