    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a wintry scene, with temperatures in the low 30s and a cloudy sky overhead. The air feels brisk and cool, accompanied by a stillness that allows the cold to settle in. As the day unfolds, expect partly sunny skies with a high near 35, though temperatures will dip to around 33 in the afternoon. The winds will pick up from the east, bringing a gentle yet noticeable movement in the air, which may lend a bit of chill as gusts could reach up to 25 mph. \n\nLooking ahead to the evening, snow is likely after midnight, potentially mixed with rain and low-lying fog, raising the chance of icy conditions as the night progresses. Temperatures are anticipated to rise slightly, hovering around the mid 30s. Those venturing outside should dress warmly in layers, ideally including a sturdy jacket and perhaps waterproof footwear considering the expected precipitation. The lakefront will likely have slightly choppy waters as the wind stirs, but overall conditions call for cautious outdoor activity. Given that it's not a holiday today, it may be best to enjoy indoor pursuits or prepare for a wintery evening at home.",
