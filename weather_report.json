    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a decidedly chilly scene, with temperatures hovering in the mid-30s and a fierce westerly wind creating a biting chill that draws one's mind to winter warmth. The sky is a blanket of gray, cloaking the landscape in a cloudy haze that only accentuates the brisk atmosphere. As the afternoon progresses, there's a 60% chance of rain and snow showers, adding to the wintry mix expected before day\u2019s end. Wind gusts may reach an unsettling 50 mph, further contributing to an uninviting feel along the shoreline of Lake Michigan.\n\nLooking ahead, tonight promises scattered snow showers, with temperatures plunging to the low teens and wind chills dipping ominously as low as -5. The wave conditions along the beach will likely be moderate, but the fierce winds may whip up the waters, creating an ominous surf. For those venturing outdoors, layering with warm attire is essential; think thick coats, hats, scarves, and insulated footwear to combat the biting cold. Given the time of year, these temperatures are typical for early December in the Midwest, where winter is now firmly established. Although not ideal for outdoor activities, the late afternoon offers a moment to appreciate the stark beauty of a Michigan winter landscape, perhaps with a brisk walk along the shore or a cozy afternoon spent indoors.",
