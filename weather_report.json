    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather paints a cold but calm picture with temperatures lingering in the low teens, bundled under a comforting layer of cloud cover. With the wind whispering barely a gust, it feels slightly chillier, making for a brisk morning perfect for those bundled up in warm winter attire. As the day unfolds, a slight chance of snow showers could dust the area, but the skies remain mostly cloudy. The forecast suggests a high near the upper 20s, gradually falling in the afternoon, accompanied by a gentle northwest breeze stoking the chill.\n\nDespite the subdued temperatures typical for early December, there\u2019s an inviting stillness to the beach scene, though its muted hues may not scream \"vacation.\" The lake's surface is likely calm, lending itself to reflective moments rather than an energetic splash. It's a good day for a warm winter coat, perhaps accessorized with a scarf and gloves, as outdoor activities might best be limited to a brisk walk or a peaceful outing with a hot drink in hand. With the holidays approaching, this day isn't marked by festivities, allowing for a quiet reprieve before the seasonal celebrations kick in.",
