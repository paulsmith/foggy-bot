    "weather_report": "As night falls in Evanston, the current conditions reflect a crisp evening at nearly 57 degrees, with a gentle breeze whispering from the west. The sky is mostly clear, offering a pleasant view of the city\u2019s shoreline as it prepares for an evening lull. However, the atmosphere is set to change overnight, as clouds will thicken and rain may begin to make an appearance after 3 a.m. Expect lows to dip into the low 40s, with mild gusts contributing to a slightly chilly feel.\n\nTomorrow, expect a partly sunny day with temperatures peaking in the upper 40s before falling back down into the low 40s by mid-afternoon. The chance of rain is notable at 50%, and reminiscent of the breezy conditions tonight, the winds will pick up a bit more, potentially reaching gusty levels. Given the forecast, it\u2019s advisable to wear a light jacket and perhaps a waterproof layer to stay comfortable against the elements. \n\nDespite the hint of rain, spending time outdoors along Lake Michigan can still be rewarding as the waves can offer a soothing soundtrack against the nighttime backdrop. With Thanksgiving fast approaching, this transition period is a great opportunity for brisk walks along the shore, provided you keep an eye on the sky for any incoming precipitation.",
