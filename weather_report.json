    "weather_report": "In Evanston, current conditions are chilly, with temperatures lingering in the mid 30s and a gentle breeze barely stirring the air. The sky is solidly overcast, casting a muted glow over the landscape, contributing to that quintessential winter feel. As we move into the overnight hours, expect a chance of rain showers, with temperatures rising slightly as we approach the morning. The forecast indicates a chance of precipitation around 50%, leading into a Wednesday that promises more rain in the air, giving way to a high in the low 40s. \n\nGiven the forecast, the atmosphere is likely to be damp, so wear something warm and waterproof if venturing outside. The wave conditions from Lake Michigan could be slightly choppy, aggravated by wind gusts that may reach 25 miles per hour during the day. Light to moderate rain could make outdoor activities less appealing, so consider indoor options or perhaps a good book by the window. As we find ourselves in late February, these temperatures are typical for the Midwest, though the overriding grayness may add an extra chill to the air. With no major holidays looming in the immediate future, it\u2019s a day to take a breath before the seasonal shifts begin in earnest.",
