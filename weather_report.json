    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston offer a moderate chill, with temperatures lingering in the upper 50s and a touch of humidity in the air, creating a somewhat damp atmosphere. The winds are fierce today, blowing in from the south at significant speeds, giving the waves on Lake Michigan a spirited appearance. The day is mostly cloudy, hinting at the potential for scattered rain showers, particularly before the afternoon hours, but there\u2019s also a promise of some sun trying to break through the cloud cover.\n\nAs we look ahead to the remainder of the day, conditions will transition to partly sunny skies, with high temperatures reaching near 60 before taking a dip in the afternoon. The winds will remain brisk, maintaining their robust nature, making it feel a bit cooler than the actual temperature. With a low expected around the upper 40s tonight, it\u2019s advisable for anyone venturing out to dress in layers, perhaps a light jacket to guard against the chill as the day progresses into evening. While the beaches may look inviting, the rough waters suggest caution if any activities are planned near the shore. Given the day's moderate temperatures and the mix of cloudy skies with sunny intervals, outdoor walks and enjoying the beach's scenic views could be quite pleasant, bearing in mind the need for a light sweater as the sun starts to set.",
