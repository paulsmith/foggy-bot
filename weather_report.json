    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current conditions present a chilly scene, with temperatures hovering in the low teens and a brisk, howling wind. The air is dry yet carries a distinct coldness that bites as evening approaches. It is mostly cloudy now but falls before a forecasted shift later in the night, where intermittent snow showers are expected between 8 PM and 10 PM. As temperatures dip further, a low of around 6 is anticipated, creating wind chill values as frigid as -8. \n\nLooking ahead to Thursday, the morning may start with a chance of snow showers, contributing to a predominantly sunny day with high temperatures near the low 20s. Despite the clearer skies, the biting wind will persist, maintaining that winter chill. Given these conditions, it\u2019s advisable to bundle up in layers, wearing insulated clothing, a warm hat, and gloves to stave off the cold. The beach may appear a bit desolate at this time of year, with elevated wave conditions likely churning the waters of Lake Michigan, making outdoor activities at the shore less inviting. While today isn\u2019t a holiday, the mid-February temperatures reflect typical winter patterns for the region, urging locals to embrace cozy indoor pursuits until spring arrives.",
