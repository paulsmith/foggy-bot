    "weather_report": "Evanston is waking up to frigid conditions this morning, with temperatures hovering in the mid to high teens and a noticeable chill in the air, particularly with the gusty winds blowing from the southwest. Despite the mostly clear skies, these brisk winds create a biting atmosphere, making it feel even colder. The beach area looking out toward Lake Michigan presents a serene yet slightly stark landscape, with clear visibility highlighting the gentle ripples of the water.\n\nFor today, expect a transition as temperatures rise toward the upper 20s, shifting to the low 30s by afternoon under a mostly sunny sky. Although the winds will calm from their morning intensity, they may still present a chill if you're venturing outdoors. Tonight, temperatures will dip again to the mid-20s, with a partly cloudy sky prevailing. As for precipitation, no significant moisture is expected, making for dry conditions. Given the winter season, these temperatures are quite typical for early December in this region, though one must still dress warmly to fend off the cold. Layering with a warm coat, gloves, and perhaps a cozy woolen hat is advisable for anyone looking to enjoy a walk along the waterfront or participate in outdoor activities. With the holiday season around the corner, it's a reminder to embrace the chilly winter charm.",
