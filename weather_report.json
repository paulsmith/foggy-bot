    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather presents a chilly scene with temperatures hovering in the low 30s, accompanied by a refreshing breeze that adds a bite to the air. The evening features mostly clear skies, promising a pleasant night for those venturing outdoors. As we look ahead, tonight will remain partly cloudy with temperatures dipping to the low 20s, and the winds will lighten, becoming more gentle from the southwest. \n\nTomorrow's forecast hints at a transition; expect partly sunny skies with temperatures peaking near the low 40s before gradually falling during the afternoon. As the day unfolds, the atmosphere should feel crisp and invigorating, ideal for activities like brisk walks by the lake or enjoying the parks amidst the early signs of spring. Currently, there is no precipitation in sight, allowing for clear vistas towards Lake Michigan. Given the time of year, with winter still holding sway, these temperatures are typical for this region, making warm layers and a hearty coat advisable for outdoor excursions. \n\nThe day is not marked by any notable celebrations, but as winter gives way to spring, it invites a spirit of exploration and outdoor enjoyment.",
