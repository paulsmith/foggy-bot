    "weather_report": "This morning in Evanston, the atmosphere is marked by a gentle chill with temperatures dipping into the low 50s, accompanied by a moderate breeze whispering from the southeast. The sky looms overcast, adding a somewhat gloomy feel to the early dawn, hinting at the rain showers expected later in the day. As the sun makes its ascent, residents can anticipate a shift in conditions. By afternoon, clouds will hang persistently, painting a gray backdrop, as rain showers are likely to roll in after noon with a 70% chance of precipitation. High temperatures are forecasted to reach up into the low 60s, then gradually sink later on.\n\nGiven the blustery winds and the likelihood of rain, it's best to don layers that include a light waterproof jacket and perhaps sturdy footwear, especially if venturing outside. As the lake waves may grow in the unsettled weather, those looking to enjoy the shore should approach with caution. While the day might not seem ideal for outdoor activities, consider cozying up at a nearby caf\u00e9, tackling some reading, or preparing for a roiling weekend by preparing the home. Today is not a holiday, but the approaching festive season sure warrants some planning.",
