    "weather_report": "As evening falls over Evanston, the air sits at a cool and damp temperature in the low 40s, accompanied by a gentle breeze swirling from the northwest. The cloudy skies cast a gray veil over the landscape, creating an atmosphere that is perhaps a bit somber but characteristically autumnal. Light rain showers are expected to transition in later tonight, meaning that a brief foray outdoors may result in some inevitable dampness. \n\nTomorrow, on Thanksgiving Day, the weather will brighten considerably as the clouds part, revealing mostly sunny skies. Highs will reach the mid-30s but will cool down as the day progresses. Wind gusts may become quite noticeable, lending a refreshing chill to the air that further emphasizes the season\u2019s transition. Given the late November timing and local geography, these conditions are very much in line with typical weather patterns for the area, albeit on the cooler side for this time of year. A warm coat, perhaps layered with a scarf, will be advisable for those venturing out, especially if enjoying the outdoors by the lake. \n\nWith the forecast for precipitation tonight, a great option would be to stay cozy indoors, perhaps enjoying a pre-Thanksgiving meal with loved ones, while tomorrow\u2019s sunny outlook invites walks along the shore or a family picnic, as the seasonal festivities draw near.",
