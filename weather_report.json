    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the early morning presents a brisk scene with temperatures hovering in the mid-teens and a sharp, blustery wind sweeping in from the southwest. The air is quite crisp, while the clear skies create an inviting outlook as the sun approaches its ascent. The day is forecasted to transition into mostly sunny conditions with temperatures climbing toward the low 30s, before settling back to around 28 this afternoon. Tonight, expect a partly cloudy sky with a low in the mid-20s, accompanied by gentler winds.\n\nAlthough the waves on Lake Michigan may pick up slightly due to the current winds, there are no significant precipitation concerns, rendering the day ultimately pleasant for outdoor explorations. It\u2019s advisable to dress warmly in layers, including a heavy coat, gloves, and a scarf to fend off the chill. As the season is firmly set in winter, the current temperatures are indeed typical for this time of year in the Midwest. Given the clear weather and the holiday ambiance of the season, activities such as a stroll along the beach or enjoying a winter walk in one of Evanston's parks would be quite enjoyable.",
