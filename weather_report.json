    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Evanston, the air is cool and humid, with a temperature hovering in the low 50s. A gusty wind from the northeast stirs the atmosphere, contributing to a cloudy sky that blankets the area. The wave conditions on Lake Michigan are likely elevated due to the brisk winds, creating a choppy surface that speaks to the prowess of nature's elements. Looking ahead, overnight temperatures are expected to dip into the mid 40s, with a slightly calmer north-northwest breeze beginning to dominate.\n\nTomorrow brings the promise of a shift as clearer skies take over, yielding a mostly sunny outlook with highs nearing 60 degrees, though temperatures will gradually fall throughout the afternoon. Although today may not present an ideal canvas for outdoor activities, the prospect of sunshine invites opportunities for a brisk walk along the waterfront or a leisurely picnic, provided one dresses warmly with layers to manage the brisk winds. Bringing along a light jacket would be advisable, especially as late fall descends. As we enjoy this transition in weather, we should remember, it's November in the Midwest\u2014a season of cooling changes and the moving of nature's breath.",
