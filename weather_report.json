    "weather_report": "As night falls over Evanston, temperatures hover in the low 20s, creating a fiercely chilly atmosphere. The wind howls out of the northwest, amplifying the cold with wind chill values plunging to -2, making it prudent to stay bundled up if venturing outside. The night sky is mostly clear, promising a serene view of the stars, though those embarking on an evening walk may find the brisk air invigorating yet biting. \n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, the forecast suggests a shift to brighter, more pleasant conditions as the sun breaks through for much of the day. Expect temperatures to edge towards the upper 20s but watch for a gradual decline in the afternoon. Wave conditions along Lake Michigan should remain calm, perfect for leisurely outings along the shore, though water enthusiasts should remain cautious of the breezy gusts that could elevate wave activity. Given the seasonal chill typical of early December in this region, clothing should prioritize warmth\u2014think heavy jackets, scarves, and gloves. While multiple festive holidays are on the horizon, today is a quiet lead-up period, making it a fine day for a brisk stroll or cozying up with a warm drink at home.",
