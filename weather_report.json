    "weather_report": "This evening in Evanston, the atmosphere is dominated by a chilly blanket of clouds, setting the tone for a rather humid and overcast night. Currently, temperatures hover in the low 60s, with a blustery wind from the southeast stirring the air, promising an unsettled night ahead. As the evening progresses, a steady chance of rain showers transitions into more persistent thunderstorms, with the mercury expected to rise slightly as the night wears on.\n\nLooking ahead to Monday, the inclement weather continues as rain showers are likely to persist until the afternoon, followed by thunderstorms that may linger throughout the day. While temperatures are projected to peak in the high 60s before dipping back into the mid-60s, such warmth is typical for early November in this region. However, with rain expected and the persistent clouds overhead, outdoor activities may indeed take a backseat this week. Consider donning a waterproof jacket or layers for warmth, and perhaps opt for indoor pursuits such as visiting local museums or enjoying a cozy caf\u00e9. Given the conditions and the nighttime hour, the beach will likely remain quiet, as gusty winds create frothy waves against the shoreline, making it less than inviting for evening strolls along the water.",
