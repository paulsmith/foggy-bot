Waves on Lake Michigan may be choppy due to the wind, creating a turbulent scene along the shoreline, which might dissuade any leisurely beach outings.\n\nLooking ahead, expect snow to persist into the night, with temperatures dropping further into the mid-teens. Layering is essential today\u2014dress warmly with insulated outerwear, hats, and gloves to keep comfortable against the wintry blast. Given the current winter season, the temperatures are typical for February in this region, though the snow adds an extra chill.
