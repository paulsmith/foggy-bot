    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the evening is marked by crisp and cool conditions, with a temperature hovering in the low 20s. The air feels quite brisk, especially with a howling wind that could whip up a chilling wind chill, dipping down to nearly -2 degrees. Currently, the skies are mostly clear, promising a serene night ahead, though tomorrow morning may bring a slightly more cheerful scene under the sun. Despite the prevailing chill, there is no precipitation in sight, allowing for a glimpse of the stars in the night sky.\n\nTomorrow, expect mostly sunny skies with highs reaching the upper 20s, but the chill will persist, transforming the air into a brisk reminder of winter\u2019s approach. The favorable weather conditions may encourage ventures outdoors, though it's wise to dress warmly\u2014layers are essential, and a good hat and gloves are recommended to ward off the biting wind. While the beach might not see swimmers, the glistening surface of Lake Michigan could attract onlookers, and the robust waters may make for some interesting wave watching, though great care should be taken given the gusty conditions. As we move through the season, temperatures are indeed typical for late November in this region, offering a quintessential winter experience without the intrusion of notable holidays in the immediate future.",
