    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the day begins under partly cloudy skies as temperatures rest in the mid 20s, presenting a crisp and cool atmosphere. The current weather is marked by a fierce and howling wind, contributing to that brisk winter feel, ideal for bundled-up outdoor activities. Conditions are expected to shift throughout the day, with clouds thickening and a high near 30 forecasted, before temperatures slightly fall to around 28 this afternoon. A slight chance of snow showers looms before midnight, but overall the precipitation risk feels quite low.\n\nConsidering the wintry conditions typical for this time of year in the Midwest, the wave activity on Lake Michigan may be somewhat boisterous due to the strong winds. Those venturing to the beach today might experience a rather unpleasant appearance of the lake and shoreline, with choppy waters and perhaps a bit of spray. Recommended attire would certainly include warm layers, insulated jackets, hats, and gloves to ward off the chill as the winds whip through the area. Given the day of the week and the current season, outdoor activities might be limited to brisk walks or quick errands; however, those who do brave the elements might find pleasure in the sheer beauty of a winter landscape contrasted against the gray skies.",
