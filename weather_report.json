    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a brisk day with temperatures hovering in the mid-20s, accompanied by some blustery winds whipping across the shoreline from the west at nearly 40 miles per hour. The air feels crisp, a sharp reminder of the season as you step outside, where you\u2019re met with a clear sky lending an expansive view over Lake Michigan. Today\u2019s forecast promises a shift as the sun shines brightly, pushing temperatures to a milder high near the upper 30s by the afternoon. A gentle breeze will offer a welcome contrast to the chill.\n\nThough pleasant in the sun, evening brings a slight chance of mixed precipitation, creating a canvas of cloud cover that might obscure the stars. Wave conditions are likely moderate with the gusty winds, so beach activities might be better suited for the early hours before the temperature dips further. For those venturing outside, layering is recommended; think warm jackets and hats for the chill, especially as evening approaches. As we close in on December, temperatures remain typical for this time of year in the Midwest, reminding us that winter is steadily arriving. Today is not a holiday, but it sets a cozy tone for the last days of November, perfect for indoor gatherings or a brisk walk to enjoy the scenery before winter takes full hold.",
