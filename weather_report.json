    "weather_report": "In Evanston, current conditions are marked by light snow and a persistent fog, creating a chilly, wintry atmosphere. With temperatures hovering in the low 30s and winds howling from the north at a brisk pace, the air feels biting and damp, typical for this season. The visibility is likely reduced as flurries drift through the air, blanketing the landscape in a fine layer of white.\n\nLooking ahead, the forecast indicates a continuation of snowy weather, with overnight lows dipping to the upper 20s, while the snow is expected to intensify tomorrow, accumulating an inch or so. The day will remain overcast with a high reaching only the mid-30s, accompanied by fierce north winds that could produce gusts up to 40 mph. Those venturing outdoors should dress warmly in layered attire against the cold and rising wind chill, and it's wise to wear waterproof gear given the likelihood of snow accumulation. Activities might be limited, but for the adventurous, a brisk walk or an outing to enjoy the holiday lights in the area could provide a refreshing experience amid the winter elements. As the season invites cozy indoor gatherings, perhaps curling up with a warm drink and watching the snow might be the best way to embrace this frosty day.",
