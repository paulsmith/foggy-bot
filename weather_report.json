    "weather_report": "The current weather in Evanston is characterized by a chilly atmosphere, with temperatures in the low 40s accompanied by a distinct dampness that makes it feel a bit colder than it is. A rather blustery wind is sweeping in from the southeast at nearly 25 miles per hour, adding a dynamic element to the foggy conditions shrouding the beach. Visibility will be somewhat limited, which, combined with the overcast skies, presents a rather muted and gray scene.\n\nAs we look ahead to the forecast for today, we can expect a modest rise in temperature, reaching into the upper 40s, with the promise of some partly sunny skies later on. This afternoon will present a softer atmosphere, though cloud cover will return this evening, bringing with it the likelihood of patchy drizzle and scattered rain showers. The chance for precipitation is hovering around 50%. Given these conditions, it would be wise to dress in layers, perhaps choosing a waterproof jacket to stay dry, especially for tonight\u2019s drizzle. Although it's a seasonal day reflecting the typical early winter chill, the forecast does provide a brief respite from this dampness in the early afternoon, allowing for some enjoyable outdoor moments, particularly for those who appreciate a brisk walk along the shoreline. As today is not a holiday, it's an ideal day for those with a bit of time off or simply looking to enjoy the local scenery and fresh air.",
