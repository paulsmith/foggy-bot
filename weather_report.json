    "weather_report": "As evening descends on Evanston, the air feels cool and somewhat clammy with a temperature hovering in the low 50s. Right now, clouds blanket the sky, casting a muted backdrop as a brisk, gusty wind dances off Lake Michigan, stirring perhaps a hint of discomfort for those unprepared. The forecast reveals that scattered rain showers are likely to begin this evening, transitioning into light drizzle after midnight, with temperatures dipping to the upper 40s. \n\nAs the night unfolds into tomorrow, drizzle and intermittent showers will persist, with temperatures gradually cooling further into the afternoon. The atmosphere remains overcast, and the winds will shift to a gentler pace, but shifts of stronger gusts could come through unexpectedly. Given the diminished temperatures and higher humidity, the scene outside may feel particularly dreary. Ideal attire would include warm layers and waterproof options to stay cozy and dry while braving the elements. \n\nFor those considering outdoor activities this holiday weekend, it may be best to take a rain check, keeping in mind the persistent discomfort and damp conditions that could limit enjoyment. With Thanksgiving just behind us today, many will be looking forward to holiday festivities, albeit spent indoors to escape the drizzly chill.",
