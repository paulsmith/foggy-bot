    "weather_report": "As temperatures hover in the low 20s and a brisk wind sweeps through Evanston, the current conditions present a rather biting feel, with wind gusts adding to the chill. The skies are clear, creating a stark contrast against the blue of Lake Michigan, though one should brace for especially frigid wind chill values reaching near zero. The forecast for the day ahead offers a promising transition as temperatures are projected to rise into the mid 30s, but they will fall back mid-afternoon, sustaining that frosty atmosphere. \n\nWith the absence of precipitation, outdoor activities could certainly be enjoyed, although the fierce winds warrant caution. Ideal attire would include layers, particularly a warm coat, gloves, and a hat to fend off the cold. Given the season, these temperatures are in line with what one can expect in late February in the Midwest, encapsulating the typical winter chill. If you're out and about today, consider going for a brisk walk on the beach or a quick stroll through a nearby park, just make sure to bundle up.",
