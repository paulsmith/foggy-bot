    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the current conditions reveal a blustery evening, with temperatures resting in the low 40s, feeling quite chilly under thick clouds. The wind is howling from the southeast at strong gusts, lending a somewhat brisk quality to the air. As we look ahead to the evening, expect patchy drizzle and scattered rain showers to sweep in, particularly between 8 and 10 PM, with overnight lows dipping to around 47. With a 40% chance of precipitation, it\u2019s wise to have an umbrella close at hand if you venture outdoors. \n\nGiven the season, this weather aligns with typical late November patterns, as we transition deeper into the heart of fall. The cloudy sky, coupled with the cool and damp conditions, creates a somewhat gloomy atmosphere. With waves lapping gently along the shoreline of Lake Michigan, it\u2019s far from a perfect beach day. If you plan to be outside, layering up is prudent; a warm jacket and perhaps a hat would be suitable to ward off the chill. While this isn't the most inviting weather for outdoor activities, cozying up indoors with a warm drink or enjoying the ambiance of a local caf\u00e9 or restaurant could bring some cheer on this muted afternoon.",
