    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Evanston, the temperatures hover in the cool mid-20s, with a biting breeze sweeping in from the east-southeast. The air feels crisp and sharp, dominated by a strong wind that whips across the beach, making it ideal to bundle up warmly before stepping outside. At this early hour, the scene is mostly obscured under a blanket of clouds, hinting at the precipitation expected later in the day. \n\nLooking ahead, expect a gloomy Saturday with cloudy skies and a high pushing toward the upper 30s. The chance of mix precipitation starts to increase after 3 PM, with sleet and rain anticipated to glide in as the day progresses\u2014so do not forget the umbrella. Waves may be somewhat choppy along the lake as the winds remain robust throughout the day, maintaining a lively rhythm upon the shore. This wintry weather, reminiscent of typical Chicago winters, calls for winter coats, gloves, and hats. Outdoor activities may be curtailed by the chill and potential for rain, making indoor pursuits more appealing, such as visiting local cafes or attending indoor events with family and friends. While today's weather lacks the cheer of sunshine, it embodies the raw beauty of a Midwestern winter day.",
