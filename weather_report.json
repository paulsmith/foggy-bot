    "weather_report": "As evening descends on Evanston, the atmosphere is brisk, with temperatures hovering in the mid-30s, a typical chill for mid-December in this lakeside community. The air feels particularly refreshing, enhanced by a gusty wind that sweeps in from the west, reminding one of winter's firm grip. Currently, the skies are partly cloudy, offering a glimpse of stars amidst the clouds, but no rain or snow is expected to dampen the mood. \n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, conditions will remain partly sunny with high temperatures barely reaching the upper 30s before retreating as the day wears on. Winds will calm down slightly, shifting to a more gentle breeze. With a thin layer of clouds and a cooling forecast, attire should lean towards warm layers, perhaps a sturdy coat, scarf, and gloves. For those in the area, the increasingly cozy evening invites indoor activities, while the daytime promises a brisk but invigorating atmosphere, perfect for a stroll along the shore or a visit to one of the local cafes to savor a warm drink. Given that today is neither a holiday nor a significant event, there\u2019s openness to seize the day with leisurely winter pursuits.",
