    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston paint a crisp and cool picture, with temperatures hovering in the mid-30s and a gentle breeze from the southeast. The sky is largely overcast, hinting at the possibility of precipitation later in the day. As we look ahead, today's forecast suggests a high in the upper 40s, with a gradual decline in temperatures through the afternoon. Winds will shift to a light breeze, making the chill feel just a touch more pronounced. \n\nTonight\u2019s forecast brings a slight chance of rain and snow showers, particularly between the evening hours and early morning, with temperatures dipping into the low 30s. The water's surface along Lake Michigan appears calm under the cloudy skies, reflecting the stillness of the day. Considering the seasonal context, this weather is typical for late November in the Midwest, when one anticipates cool temperatures and the potential for wintery conditions. For those venturing outside, layering up will be essential to stay warm, as both the tranquility of the lake and the threat of wet weather may make for less-than-ideal outdoor activities. Perhaps a cozy evening at home or a stroll along the lakeshore, bundled up against the chill, might be the perfect way to embrace the day.",
