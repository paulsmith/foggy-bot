    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly, overcast night, with temperatures lingering in the mid-30s, creating an invigorating but brisk atmosphere. The wind is fierce, whipping through the area at nearly 54 mph, generating a sense of unrest among the trees and the waves of Lake Michigan, which appear choppy. A slight chance of rain showers lingers through the night, but the forecasted lows indicate temperatures will dip to the low 30s.\n\nAs we look ahead to Thanksgiving Day, expect a transition to mostly sunny skies, providing a welcome contrast to the current cloud cover. Highs will peak near 36 degrees, though they will nudge downwards through the afternoon as a gentle northwesterly breeze continues. The wave conditions in the lake may remain tumultuous due to tonight's turbulent winds, suggesting caution for any water activities. Recommended attire for those venturing outside should include warm layers and a wind-resistant coat, particularly with the potential for gusty winds early in the day. As we traverse through the late November season in the Midwest, these temperatures align fairly well with seasonal expectations, marking a typical winter's eve. \n\nFor tomorrow, as families gather to celebrate Thanksgiving, outdoor activities such as a brisk walk along the beach could be refreshing, provided one is bundled appropriately against the brisk air. The shifting weather from cloudy to sunny could also provide a perfect backdrop for festive gatherings, but keep an eye on the conditions, especially near the water.",
