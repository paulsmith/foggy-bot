    "weather_report": "In the current evening scene of Evanston, temperatures hover in the chilly low 50s, accompanied by a soft and soothing calmness that envelops the lakefront. With a humidity level that brings a slight coolness to the air, conditions feel refreshingly brisk, perfect for a peaceful stroll along the beach. Tonight's forecast predicts a mostly cloudy night, with the mercury dipping to the mid 40s, urging outdoor enthusiasts to bundle up for any late-night activities.\n\nLooking ahead to Saturday, the clouds are expected to persist, yet the afternoon may see a gentle rise to around the low 50s, giving way to a light breeze from the south, along with occasional gusts that could stir the surface of Lake Michigan into playful ripples. As rain isn't in the cards, attendees of potential outdoor gatherings or beachgoers should relish the opportunity for a refreshing day spent amidst nature. Given the season, these cool temperatures are typical for mid-November in this region, where the autumn air begins to hint at winter's arrival. While it is not a holiday today, local residents might enjoy various outdoor activities while donning their coziest jackets.",
