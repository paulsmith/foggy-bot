    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the current weather paints a picture of a brisk, unsettling autumn day. With temperatures in the low 50s, a heavy blanket of clouds hangs overhead while the wind howls from the southeast, making for a blustery atmosphere. The humidity feels comfortably damp but not oppressive, typical of this transitional season. Ocean waves at the beach reflect the restless sky, where gusty winds stir up a bit more energy on Lake Michigan.\n\nToday\u2019s forecast indicates that rain showers are likely to invade the area after noon, with overall conditions remaining cloudy. The high will reach the low 60s, but temperatures are expected to decrease into the afternoon, with precipitation chances skyrocketing to a full 100% tonight, making an umbrella a necessity. Given this weather, it's wise to don weatherproof attire, including a lightweight rain jacket and sturdy footwear. The season aligns well with typical autumn temperatures, though today feels more like a display of nature's unpredictability. Indoor activities may be preferable, such as visiting local caf\u00e9s or enjoying cultural sites, as the rain promises to dampen outdoor plans by the evening.",
