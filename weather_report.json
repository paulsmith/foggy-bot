    "weather_report": "In Evanston this afternoon, residents are greeted with mostly cloudy skies and a temperature settling into the low 50s, creating a cool environment that feels fresh yet slightly damp. The day carries a hint of anticipation as a slight chance of rain showers looms after 5 PM, with thermometers peaking around the mid-50s before starting to drop. Winds from the south-southwest will add a gentle touch, reaching up to 15 mph, potentially stirring the air and inviting those outdoors to bundle just a tad more.\n\nTonight, however, a more pronounced shift is expected, with occasional rain showers expected to roll in as the temperature drifts down to the high 30s. Winds will calm somewhat, but still maintain a subtle presence, reminding us of the chill that's typical for this time of year. As precipitation approaches, it's advisable to don a waterproof jacket if venturing out, as conditions may turn increasingly damp. The scene at the beach by Lake Michigan is undeniably winter-like\u2014ideal for a brisk stroll, though the chill may make time spent outdoors feel fleeting. Overall, as winter continues its hold, today's temperatures align with seasonal expectations, offering a typical, yet refreshing, January afternoon in the Midwest.",
