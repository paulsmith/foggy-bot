    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly atmosphere, with temperatures hovering in the mid to high 30s. The air carries a briskness, stirred by a fierce wind sweeping in from the west, creating a sharp bite particularly along the lakeshore. With skies partly cloudy, visibility remains reasonably clear, but as night descends, the beach presents a tranquil yet stark scene. Wave activity is likely amplified by the wind, suggesting a lively lakefront that could be both beautiful and tumultuous at times.\n\nThe forecast for tonight hints at more of the same: partly cloudy skies and cooling temperatures dipping further down towards freezing. The winds will mellow slightly, making for a less blustery experience, though still brisk enough to need a warm layer when stepping outdoors. In this cold season, the current temperatures are quite typical for mid-December in this region, which is known for its frigid climate. Given these conditions, cozy attire is advisable\u2014think heavy coats, warm scarves, and perhaps a hat to keep the cold at bay. For those longing to embrace the outdoors, a stroll along the beach could provide a serene escape, though one should be cautious of the wind and chill. As a reminder, this evening does not mark a holiday, but the spirit of the season is certainly in the air, inviting reflective moments before the festivities commence in just a few days.",
