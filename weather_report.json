    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly scene, with temperatures resting in the low 40s and an oppressive blanket of fog shrouding the area. The air is thick, contributing to a rather gloomy atmosphere along the beach. The wind is howling at a brisk pace, making it feel even cooler and stirring the waters of Lake Michigan. The ongoing fog and the high chance of light rain in the forecast suggest limited visibility, so outdoor activities may be hampered by these damp and dreary conditions.\n\nAs we look ahead to Monday, expect continued cloudy skies and areas of fog with temperatures expected to peak in the high 40s before they gradually decline in the afternoon. Gusty winds from the southwest will make their presence known, pushing through at around 10 to 15 mph and creating choppy wave conditions on the lake. Dress warmly in layers, perhaps with a waterproof layer handy, as light rain may dampen the day ahead. Given these conditions, it might be best to stay indoors, enjoying a cozy cup of coffee or catching up on reading, rather than venturing out to the beach.",
