    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather presents a rather dreary spectacle, with light drizzle falling amid a thick blanket of fog and mist. The temperature is in the low 50s, with a relentless, chilly wind from the southeast that adds a brisk edge to the air. This combination of high humidity results in an overall damp and chilly feel, making the outdoors less inviting for those unprepared. \n\nLooking ahead to the day, expect persistent drizzle and rain showers, particularly before noon, while overcast skies will dominate the scene. Temperatures will hover around the mid-50s, with the brisk breeze potentially raising a few gusts that might catch you off guard. As rain amounts are projected to be modest, the lake's typical calm may be disrupted with gentle waves, but conditions will still be manageable for most. For those venturing outdoors, layered clothing is recommended, with waterproof outerwear essential to combat the pervasive dampness. \n\nAs we are in the late autumn season, the temperatures align with what is typical for the region, although it does carry a melancholic charm. Today is certainly not the best for outdoor activities, but a cozy afternoon at a local caf\u00e9, away from the rain, could provide a pleasant alternative.",
