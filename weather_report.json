    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather presents a cool and slightly oppressive atmosphere, with faded temperatures in the low 60s, accompanied by a damp and humid feel that might leave one seeking shelter. A strong and gusty wind from the south stirs up the air, reaching speeds that could ruffle nearby foliage and create an energetic buzz along the shorelines of Lake Michigan. The night sky looms heavy with clouds, setting the stage for the impending rain that is expected shortly.\n\nAs the night progresses into Monday morning, expect rain to arrive, possibly accompanied by a few rumbles of thunder as the temperatures hover near the upper 50s, gradually creeping into the low 60s with a gentle rise in warmth. The prospect of thunderstorms keeps today\u2019s activities somewhat subdued, making it better suited for indoor plans. Waves may be elevated with the wind's fierce demeanor, presenting a rough and choppy Lake Michigan, not ideal for boating or swimming. In keeping with the mood, it's advisable to don waterproof attire, perhaps a light raincoat or umbrella, to navigate the wet and breezy conditions comfortably. While the season may typically boast a range of crisp October days, tonight serves as a reminder that the winds of change often bring unpredictable weather, nudging us toward the cozy interiors of our homes as we prepare for a rain-swept day ahead.",
