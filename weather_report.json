    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly, wintry scene with light snow falling and temperatures hovering in the mid 20s. The air feels particularly crisp due to brisk winds blowing from the northwest, creating a biting chill that underscores the snowy landscape. As the day unfolds, more snow is expected before the sun climbs higher, transitioning to intermittent snow showers and overcast skies. With a maximum temperature only reaching near the upper 20s later on, it\u2019s likely to feel quite raw, particularly with wind gusts nearing 40 miles per hour.\n\nAs evening approaches, conditions will only get more frigid, dropping to around 3 degrees, accentuated by wind chills plummeting to minus 15. Given the snow-covered beach and icy shores along Lake Michigan, wave conditions are likely to be turbulent, posing dangers for any waterfront activities. Residents are advised to dress warmly in layered clothing, including hats and heavy winter coats, if venturing outdoors. With the cold season firmly in place, these temperatures are consistent with a typical Chicago winter. While the weather isn\u2019t inviting for outdoor leisure, a cozy day indoors with warm drinks might be the ideal way to manage the wintry chill.",
