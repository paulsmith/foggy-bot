    "weather_report": "The current weather in Evanston, Illinois, presents a chilly scene with temperatures in the mid-teen range and a brisk wind howling from the southwest. With the day starting clear, the atmosphere feels incredibly crisp, though it carries a bite that one might feel while standing near icy Lake Michigan. As the day progresses, the forecast predicts notably warmer conditions, with sunny skies lifting temperatures toward the mid-30s, giving way to a clearer and more comfortable afternoon. \n\nWave conditions should be on the calmer side, although the lake may still maintain a restless demeanor with some movement from the gusty winds. Fortunately, there\u2019s no precipitation expected, ensuring a dry day for anyone choosing to venture outside. With the forecast suggesting a sunny afternoon, layers are recommended to combat the lingering chill, perhaps a warm coat complemented by a knitted hat and gloves for the morning. As winter lingers, these temperatures are not unusual for this time of year in northern Illinois. Outdoor enthusiasts may find this a perfect opportunity to enjoy a brisk walk along the beach and relish the beauty of a winter landscape under clear skies.",
