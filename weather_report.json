    "weather_report": "The conditions in Evanston paint a picture of a chilly and misty evening, with temperatures hovering in the upper 50s. There's a thick fog enveloping the area, contributing to an atmosphere that's both damp and slightly uncomfortable, especially with the howling winds sweeping across the beach from the southeast. These gusts, reaching nearly 54 miles per hour, whip through the air, making the shoreline a challenging place for any evening stroll.\n\nAs night deepens, rain showers are anticipated after 11 PM, with a certainty of precipitation approaching 100%. With cloudy skies forecasted for Tuesday and a brief chance of lingering rain in the morning, residents might experience a continuing dampness throughout the day, with highs only crawling up to the mid to upper 50s. The choppy waves of Lake Michigan may be quite robust, making the shoreline unwelcoming for water activities. Given these conditions, layering is advisable\u2014think warm and waterproof, perhaps even boots if venturing out. As we are nearing the season's end, this typical November chill and moisture remind us of the Midwest's upcoming winter months. For those considering outdoor plans, it may be wise to stay indoors or enjoy cozy activities at home, avoiding the treacherous elements that await outside.",
