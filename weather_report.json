    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reflect a chilly evening, with the temperature hovering in the mid-20s paired with a layer of clouds overhead, creating a gray, muted atmosphere along the lakeshore. The air feels crisp yet slightly humid, making it a quintessential winter night. As the evening progresses, temperatures are expected to rise slightly, reaching the low 30s overnight, with a gentle east southeast breeze that could stir up a bit more chill. \n\nLooking ahead to Saturday, the forecast suggests a mix of freezing drizzle and light snow beginning late in the morning, softening into a potentially messy afternoon. The high will struggle to reach the mid-30s, potentially followed by temperatures falling again, complemented by a blustery east wind that may accentuate the wintry feel. Precipitation is likely, but little or no ice accumulation is anticipated. This chilly weather aligns well with February in Illinois, where cool, often turbulent conditions are the norm. Considering these elements, bundled layers\u2014coats, gloves, and perhaps a hat\u2014are recommended for outdoor activities. While the beach might call to some, caution is advised due to the impending weather. This Saturday doesn't overlay with any major holidays, yet the imminent snowfall could inspire cozy indoor activities or quick outdoor errands before the weather shifts.",
