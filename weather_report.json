    "weather_report": "As the morning unfolds in Evanston, residents are greeted by a chilly scene with temperatures hovering in the low 30s and a brisk wind from the west. Light snow currently blankets the area, contributing to a wintry atmosphere that feels quite raw, especially with the winds gusting fiercely. The visibility is obscured, suggesting a generally dreary outlook for the coast along Lake Michigan. \n\nLooking ahead, the forecast indicates a snowy morning will transition into a mix of rain and snow by early afternoon, with expected snow accumulation adding to the existing layer, making for a slippery afternoon commute. The temperature is predicted to rise to the high 40s, moderated by a strong, gusty breeze that promises to keep things feeling rather brisk. If venturing outdoors, dressing warmly in layers is essential, as the combination of wind and moisture will leave those unprepared feeling quite cold. Given these conditions, it might be best to postpone outdoor activities. Instead, consider cozying up indoors with a warm drink as the winter weather settles in.",
