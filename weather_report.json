    "weather_report": "The current weather in Evanston, Illinois, offers a wintry scene with light snow and a temperature that\u2019s teetering on the edge of the low 20s. The air feels brisk and biting, especially with the strong winds stirring from the west, creating a particularly chill in the air. As we look towards today\u2019s forecast, we can expect intermittent snow showers to continue with cloud coverage lingering overhead. Temperatures will reach a high near the mid-20s, then gradually drop into the evening as we settle down to a low of about 17, accompanied by steady breezy winds.\n\nWith the beach views revealing a calm Lake Michigan, wave conditions are likely to be gentle, though the biting cold and gusty winds make for an uninviting atmosphere outside. This is not a day for leisurely strolls along the shoreline, but rather one to bundle up warmly for any necessary outings. Given the season, this chill is typical for late November, a reminder that winter's grip is tightening. Layers such as thermal jackets, hats, and gloves are strongly advised to fend off the evening's chill. \n\nOverall, unless one has pressing business outdoors, today may be best spent indoors, perhaps curling up with a good book or enjoying the company of friends.",
