    "weather_report": "Tonight in Evanston, the atmosphere is charged with the potential of showers and thunderstorms as a warm front moves through the area. The sky, mostly cloudy now, will soon pulse with the rhythm of rain and lightning as temperatures settle around 64 degrees, gradually rising to about 66. Winds from the south-southwest will whip through the region at speeds of 15 to 25 mph, with gusts possibly reaching up to 40 mph, painting a rather restless scene along the shoreline. With an 80% chance of precipitation, it\u2019s clear that those venturing outside would do well to carry an umbrella and dress in layers to adapt to the shifting temperatures.\n\nAs Thursday unfolds, expect more rain and thunderstorms in the early part of the day, tapering off by early afternoon. The high of 66 will give way to cooler temperatures, dropping to about 56 as the storm season echoes the transition into fall. Though the waves may appear agitated under the driving wind, today's conditions suggest a noticing calm rather than a recreational invitation to the beach. Given the weather, it\u2019s an opportune time for some indoor activities\u2014perhaps a warm drink at a local caf\u00e9 or a leisurely visit to a nearby library, allowing for a cozy retreat from the blustery evening ahead.",
