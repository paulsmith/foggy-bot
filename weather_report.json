    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston paint a wintry scene with temperatures hovering in the low 30s, complemented by a damp and chilly atmosphere accentuated by gusty winds. Snow and fog cast a muted pall over the landscape, creating a quiet yet somber mood along the beach. As the day progresses, residents can expect more snow until this afternoon, transitioning to drizzle as the high reaches the low 40s. The brisk northwesterly winds will add a notable chill, with gusts capable of wreaking havoc on an otherwise mild day.\n\nThe outlook for later today suggests a continued wintry presence with limited accumulation expected, thanks to a shift towards rain in the evening. The ambiance by the shoreline is likely to remain rather unpleasant, a muted palette of grays dominating the view, with the surf likely following suit\u2014potentially calm but marked by a cold bite. As for attire, layering is advisable; a warm coat, sturdy boots, and perhaps a water-resistant layer will help combat the harsh elements. These cold temperatures are typical for this time of year in a Midwestern winter, where the seasons remind us of their fortitude. While the beach may seem less than inviting today, perhaps a steaming cup of coffee at a nearby caf\u00e9 or some indoor activity could provide momentary solace from the brisk, snow-laden air.",
