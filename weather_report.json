    "weather_report": "As dusk falls over Evanston, the weather presents a rather dreary picture. Currently, temperatures hover in the mid-40s, accompanied by a blanket of fog and mist that shrouds the shoreline. The breeze is brisk, lending an almost biting edge to the air, creating an atmosphere that feels more like the depths of winter than the tail end of December. The prevailing conditions are suitable for a quiet, introspective evening rather than outdoor festivities.\n\nThe forecast for the night warns of patchy fog and a chance of light rain, with temperatures expected to dip into the low 40s. A gentle wind from the south-southeast will likely add a chill to the air, and as the evening progresses, the likelihood of rain increases, with up to a quarter of an inch expected tomorrow. Wave conditions on Lake Michigan appear moderately active, reflecting the gusty wind. This might deter any ambitious beachgoers, as the combination of moisture in the air and the chill makes for an uncomfortable outing. \n\nFor those venturing outside this evening, layering becomes essential; a warm coat paired with a scarf and perhaps even a hat will offer some solace against the cool air. With the current season being winter, the temperatures are somewhat typical for this time of year in the Midwest, though the prevalent dampness does amplify the cold impression. Activities are best suited indoors\u2014perhaps enjoying a warm drink while spending time with family, especially since today is celebrated for being just after Christmas, a time for reflection and togetherness.",
