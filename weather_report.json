    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston depict a chilly scene, with temperatures settled in the mid-30s, accompanied by a thick blanket of clouds that obscure the sky. The air carries a crisp bite, further intensified by a brisk breeze from the southwest, creating a raw and slightly uncomfortable atmosphere. No precipitation is anticipated at present, with only patchy fog gracing the overnight hours, likely making for a somewhat eerie silhouette along the shoreline of Lake Michigan.\n\nAs the sun rises, a shift is on the horizon for Sunday. After the morning's fog dissipates, expect a glimpse of brightness as the day warms to the low 50s. Winds will remain gentle to moderate, providing a stirring yet manageable environment. With such a cool day ahead, layering is a wise choice, ideally opting for a warm jacket and perhaps a cozy scarf to fend off the chill when outdoors, especially near the water where that breeze may feel a bit sharper.\n\nConsidering it's a weekend in late November, myriad outdoor activities might be limited, but the condition is perfect for a brisk walk along the beach, allowing one to embrace the serene beauty of the lake\u2019s wintery fa\u00e7ade. The temperature aligns well with typical late fall expectations, so while the weather may not invite long strolls without warm attire, it certainly paints a picturesque scene worthy of contemplative moments by the water.",
