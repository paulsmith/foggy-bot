    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the current scene is a chilly one, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s. The air carries a brisk, biting wind that adds to the overall coolness, creating a rather stark, wintry ambiance. Clouds hang heavily above, creating a gray backdrop that hints at precipitation. Looking ahead, expect a mix of rain and snow later this afternoon, with temperatures rising only slightly to the mid 30s. The chance of precipitation is significant, particularly tonight, when the forecast calls for snow and drizzle. New snow accumulation is expected to remain light, yet the air will have an increasingly damp feel as the temperature dips to around freezing.\n\nWith these conditions, the lakeshore presents a somewhat dreary appearance, waves are likely to be moderate given the fresh gusts from the south, stirring the waters of Lake Michigan. For those venturing outdoors, dressing warmly in layers is advisable\u2014a heavy coat, gloves, and perhaps a hat are essential to fend off the chill. While the season is typical for this time of year, the impending snow offers a nod to the festive spirit, as we approach the Christmas holiday. Whether it's a brisk walk by the lake or finding comfort indoors with a warm drink, today encourages a blend of cozy pursuits and contemplative moments by the shore.",
