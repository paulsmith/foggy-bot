    "weather_report": "Under a mostly cloudy sky, Evanston is experiencing a cool and damp night, with temperatures in the low 50s, accompanied by a gusty breeze that adds a brisk edge to the air. The humidity is palpable, contributing to a sense of chill as the wind howls from the west at a vigorous pace. Tonight\u2019s conditions are expected to dip to the mid to upper 40s, so it may feel quite chilly as nighttime settles in. \n\nAs we look to Veterans Day, the forecast promises a shift to mostly sunny skies with a high reaching the mid-50s. Winds will continue at a lively clip, creating potential for brisk gusts that will keep things feeling fresh. Wave conditions along Lake Michigan may be moderate due to these winds, which could lead to some choppy waters, particularly for small crafts. With the weather oscillating between cool and mildly pleasant throughout the day, dressing in layers will be wise\u2014consider a light jacket and perhaps a hat to fend off the chill. While early November is typically a time for cooler weather in this region, today's temperatures are right in keeping with the season. As such, the conditions invite either a brisk walk along the beach or perhaps a visit to local cafes to enjoy the fall ambiance, making for a lovely daytime outing.",
