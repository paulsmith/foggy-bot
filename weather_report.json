    "weather_report": "Evanston, Illinois, is currently shrouded in a thick veil of fog and mist, with temperatures lingering in the low 40s, contributing to a damp and chilly atmosphere. The light, whispering breeze from the south at about 12 miles per hour carries a hint of drizzle, and visibility is significantly reduced. As the day unfolds, expect cloudy skies with temperatures climbing slightly to around the mid-40s, leaving a damp chill in the air that may feel even cooler. Conditions will remain murky, with the possibility of additional patchy drizzle and fog persisting into the night, where temperatures might stabilize in the low 40s as the winds pick up slightly.\n\nGiven today\u2019s dreary and damp conditions, beach visits might not be appealing, and outdoor activities could be limited. A warm, waterproof jacket and sturdy shoes would be advised for anyone venturing out, as the moist air adds a layer of discomfort. While it is not particularly harsh for mid-December in this region, the cold, clammy feel makes for a day best spent indoors, perhaps enjoying a cozy read by the window or exploring local cafes. Today is December 15, but it's not a major holiday; however, the holiday spirit is undoubtedly in the air as we approach the festivities.",
