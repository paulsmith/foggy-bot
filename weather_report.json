    "weather_report": "Current weather conditions in Evanston, Illinois, paint a chilly and damp picture. The temperature hovers in the low 50s, creating a slightly muggy feel, intensified by high humidity levels around 96 percent. The air is still, with little to no wind stirring, contributing to an overall subdued ambiance. As dawn draws nearer, widespread drizzle and rain showers are on the horizon, along with patchy fog likely to linger through the morning. Today's forecast suggests a cloudy day with a high reaching into the mid 50s, but temperatures will drop to the low 50s this afternoon. As the day progresses, expect a gentle westward breeze picking up in intensity, possibly leading to gusty conditions.\n\nConsidering these elements, the scene at the beach will lack clarity and vibrancy, leaning towards a more muted, somber appearance with raindrops potentially flickering on the surface of Lake Michigan. The waves may be modest, not particularly high, fitting for a drizzly day along the shore. Attire wise, a light jacket or raincoat is recommended, coupled with waterproof footwear if venturing outdoors. In terms of broaching seasonal norms, this fall day aligns reasonably well with expected temperatures for mid-November in the Midwest, marking the gradual shift into colder days ahead. Activities may gravitate towards indoor venues, perfect for enjoying warm beverages and cozy gatherings as the rain falls, or perhaps a reflective stroll along the shoreline for those unfazed by the drizzle. Today is a typical day leading into the heart of autumn, with no major holiday celebrations marking the calendar aside from the approaching Thanksgiving in a week\u2019s time.",
