    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a chilly evening with temperatures lingering in the mid to upper 20s, complemented by a gentle breeze that stirs the air, lending a crisp edge to the atmosphere. As clouds gradually blanket the sky, there's a subtle transition into mostly cloudy skies overnight. The forecast for Sunday calls for a more welcoming shift, as partly sunny skies promise a high in the low 40s, though temperatures will ease into the upper 30s by afternoon. \n\nWith wave conditions likely reflecting the gentle undulations of early spring alongside the moderate winds, outdoor enthusiasts might find the beach a bit brisk, yet invigorating. There\u2019s no significant precipitation expected; thus, it remains dry for all outdoor plans. For those venturing outside, warm layers are advisable given the persistent chill, with a focus on preparing for the upcoming drop in temperature as the day progresses. The current weather is typical for late February in the Midwest, a stark reminder of winter's grip, though the promise of spring warmth lingers just on the horizon. Given the day and upcoming weeks, light outdoor activities might be heartily enjoyed if bundled for warmth, such as walks along the lakeshore or brief visits to local parks as hints of milder weather begin to emerge.",
