    "weather_report": "In Evanston today, the weather presents a chilly and cloud-draped scene. Currently, temperatures hover in the mid-30s, accompanied by a brisk and blustery wind out of the west-northwest, adding a sharp edge to the cool air. As the day progresses, we can expect the overcast sky to persist, with temperatures peaking near the upper 30s before gradually slipping down to the mid-20s tonight. The wind may taper off slightly in intensity but could still deliver brisk gusts, maintaining that raw, wintry feel. \n\nConditions are not particularly inviting for outdoor activities, as the cloud cover lends a somber tone to the environment, while the waves on Lake Michigan are likely to be choppy given the wind. While potential precipitation is absent from the forecast, it\u2019s advisable to dress warmly and in layers, considering a winter coat and perhaps a scarf to shield against the chill. This time of year typically features temperatures within this range, signaling that we've settled into the winter months. Despite the less-than-pleasant weather, a brisk walk along the shoreline could refresh the spirit, so long as you're prepared for the cold.",
