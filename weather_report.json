    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly afternoon with temperatures hovering in the mid to high 50s. The air carries a brisk edge, marked by gusty winds sweeping in from the west-southwest, presenting a slightly blustery feel that may deter some from lingering outdoors. The sky hangs heavily, cloaked in clouds with a promise of clearing as the day progresses. As evening approaches, the temperature is expected to dip toward the low 40s, with the slight possibility of rain showers surfacing after 3 AM.\n\nDespite the impending coolness of the night, today bears a moderately pleasant aspect, framed by the shifting light and the muted shimmer of Lake Michigan. However, as the waves meet the shoreline, they are calm but might chop up later with increased winds. For those venturing outside, layering is advisable; a light jacket or sweater would suffice for the current coolness, complemented by a hat to shield against the drizzle that might come later. This time of year typically ushers in cooler temperatures, and today's weather aligns closely with seasonal norms. Given the brisk air, invigorating walks along the beach or visits to local cafes may be the perfect way to embrace this quintessential late autumn day.",
