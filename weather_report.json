    "weather_report": "Currently, Evanston experiences a notably brisk afternoon with the temperature in the low 50s and a blusterous wind sweeping through the area. The day appears mostly clear, though the skies hold a promise of scattered rain showers later in the afternoon, creating an evolving scene over Lake Michigan. As we look towards the horizon, the waves may be choppy today with the gusty winds stirring the surface, making it more suitable for a relaxed stroll along the beach rather than swimming or venturing into the water.\n\nLooking ahead, expect cloudier skies as the sun begins to dip, giving way to potential scattered snow showers by tonight, with temperatures dropping to the low 30s. With such brisk conditions and a 50% chance of experiencing some snow, it will be wise for residents and visitors to dress warmly\u2014layering is recommended to fend off the chill. While the current weather aligns closely with typical late fall temperatures in this region, the blustery winds heighten the cool feel of the day. Given the conditions and seasonal ambiance, taking a walk on the beach or visiting nearby parks could be enjoyable, particularly for those who appreciate a fresh, invigorating outing before the colder months settle in fully.",
