    "weather_report": "As we look out across Evanston this evening, the temperature hovers in the upper 30s, creating a crisp chill that's accentuated by the moisture in the air. The current overcast sky casts a muted gray light, making the atmosphere feel particularly subdued, as gusts of wind sweep in from the southwest, swirling leaves and stirring up the lake beyond. Tonight, we can expect to see patchy fog roll in, coupled with some drizzle, settling into the low 30s as the evening wears on. For those venturing out, a light jacket is advisable, perhaps layered with a sweater for comfort against the damp chill. \n\nTomorrow presents a touch more brightness with areas of fog in the morning, yet slowly yielding to partly sunny skies by midday. Temperatures will climb to the low 50s, but be prepared for a slight drop in the afternoon, accompanied by a gentle breeze. The waves along the shore are subdued, inviting the occasional stroll but not necessarily inspiring a dip into the lake. Given the current season, these temperatures align with typical late November conditions in this part of the Midwest, where the air feels cooler as we approach winter. While it may not be the most enticing weather for outdoor gatherings, a cozy day indoors with a warm drink could be just the remedy for this brisk, drizzly evening.",
