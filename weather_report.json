    "weather_report": "As evening settles in Evanston, the temperature stands comfortably in the low 50s, accompanied by a humid feel that hints at previous rainfall. The sky is shrouded in clouds, casting a muted light across the landscape. A brisk breeze from the northwest stirs the air, bringing a chill that adds a slight bite to the atmosphere. Tonight, expect isolated rain showers to sweep through before 8 p.m., with mostly cloudy skies lingering afterwards and temperatures dipping to around the mid 40s. \n\nReflecting on the season, these temperatures are typical for early November in this region, as autumn bids farewell and winter edges closer. Waves on Lake Michigan are likely subdued due to the cooler conditions, offering a peaceful yet slightly unsettled shore. If venturing out, layering is essential\u2014a warm jacket paired with a light hat may be enough to keep comfortable against the brisk winds. While cozy indoor activities might be best, an evening stroll along the beach could provide a moment of tranquility, rewarding those who brave the weather with a glimpse of the lake\u2019s reflections under the muted sky.",
