    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a briskly chilly atmosphere, with the temperature hovering in the low 20s and a noticeable bluster from the northwest. The skies are mostly cloudy, though there\u2019s a promise of partial sunshine later in the day. Residents can expect a slight chance of snow flurries before 5 PM, adding a quiet touch to the evening. The lake is likely displaying gentle waves, perfect for a calming sight but not inviting for a splash. \n\nAs we move into the evening, the temperature is predicted to dip into the upper teens, necessitating warm layers for anyone desiring a stroll along the shore. Given the typical seasonal chill of early December in the Midwest, this weather is well within expected ranges. For those searching for activities, a cozy evening indoors with festive preparations is preferable, rather than outdoor excursions. With no major holidays approaching in the immediate timeframe, it remains a simple December day along Lake Michigan, wrapped in serene beauty.",
