    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a brisk and biting atmosphere, with temperatures hovering in the low single digits and a fierce wind creating an added chill. This morning, the air is clear, but the sight of the beach, illuminated only by artificial lights against the backdrop of Lake Michigan, is stark and desolate. Wave action along the shoreline might be unsettled, whipped into a frothy chatter by that howling breeze, but no precipitation is expected to dampen the crispness of the day.\n\nAs we look ahead, the forecast hints at partly cloudy skies later, with temperatures climbing to the upper 20s this Friday, complemented by a gentle northeast wind. This will create a slightly more inviting atmosphere, though wind chill may continue to linger near the freezing mark. Dress warmly, layering insulated clothing to fend off the cold, especially if venturing outdoors. In winter-swept Evanston, these temperatures are typical for December, as the season firmly establishes its grip. As the tranquility of a winter day envelops the town, consider a brisk walk along the beach or a cozy afternoon in a local caf\u00e9, savoring warm beverages to counter the chilly air. There's no major holiday today, but the spirit of the season can be felt as community members prepare for upcoming festivities.",
