    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a brisk and blustery scene, with temperatures holding steady in the low teens. The atmosphere is marked by a layer of clouds overhead, contributing to a chilly yet invigorating outdoor environment. Moving into the afternoon, expect mostly cloudy skies with a slight increase in temperature, peaking around the mid-teens. However, wind chill could make it feel as frigid as zero, with gusty winds from the west adding to the bite of the cold.\n\nAs the light wanes this evening, temperatures will dip further to the low single digits, complemented by a potentially brisk northwest breeze. The lake, though calm in appearance, may churn slightly with gentle waves, suggesting appropriate conditions for bundled visitors enjoying the landscape. Precipitation is absent in the immediate forecast, so the day will remain dry, though the crisp air provides a refreshing element typical for this season in the Midwest. Given these conditions, layered clothing is recommended\u2014warm sweaters or jackets, along with hats and gloves for those brave enough to venture outdoors. While the weather might not invite leisurely strolls along the beach, it is ideal for brisk walks or cozy gatherings indoors, perhaps with a warm beverage, as we head into the heart of winter.",
