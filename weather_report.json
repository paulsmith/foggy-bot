    "weather_report": "Current weather conditions in Evanston reflect a blustery chill, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s and a fierce wind adding to the bite of the air. It's a cloudy scene, the kind that evokes a sense of somber beauty, as wave activity along Lake Michigan picks up in response to the wind's howl. As the day progresses, a chance of snow showers looms, with a forecasted high barely reaching into the low 30s before a drop to around 22 in the afternoon. Expect about an inch of new snow, adding a wintry sparkle to the atmosphere, albeit with a wind chill that could feel as low as -14 later tonight.\n\nIn this winter setting, bundled attire is a must\u2014think insulated coats, warm hats, and thick gloves. The chilly conditions align well with this time of year, being decidedly typical for December in the Midwest. With gusty winds and scattered snow expected, outdoor activities may be limited, but it could be an ideal moment for cozy indoor pursuits or a brisk walk if you're well-prepared for the elements. Today is not a holiday, and with the impending winter scenery, it captures the essence of the season perfectly.",
