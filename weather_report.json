    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston paint a brisk picture, with temperatures settled in the mid 30s, accompanied by a blanket of damp air. The weather bears the bite of chill, with a howling wind that could catch even seasoned Midwesterners off guard, providing a stark reminder of the winter's embrace. While the sky braves partial clouds, expect a muted ambiance typical of the season. Tonight, temperatures are set to dip slightly, reaching the low 30s as a gentle west wind stirs. \n\nTomorrow offers a slightly more inviting atmosphere, with partly sunny skies and high temperatures near 40 degrees, though these will likely descend into the high 30s by afternoon. The waves lapping at the shores of Lake Michigan remain somewhat restless, a reflection of the strong winds persisting through the night. As for precipitation, a dry spell is expected, allowing for an evening stroll or daytime venture; however, prepare for the unmistakable chill. Given the seasonality of December in the Midwest, these conditions feel characteristic, leaning toward a quintessential winter experience. As the holiday season approaches, the spirit of the season is in the air, making for delightful opportunities for walks in the park or quiet moments by the lakeside, if bundled warmly.",
