    "weather_report": "Current weather conditions in Evanston reveal a temperature in the mid 40s, accompanied by mostly cloudy skies, creating a brisk and cool atmosphere. As the day continues, expect partly sunny skies with a high reaching near 49, slightly cooling to around 44 later in the afternoon. This evening, the clouds will shift to a partly cloudy formation, leading to a chilly night with lows around the mid 30s. Winds from the southwest will be noticeable, picking up to light and gusty speeds, especially this afternoon. \n\nThe overall scene presents a rather gloomy yet serene coastline, with no precipitation in sight. As for wave conditions, while the wind may create some gentle ripples, it's not expected to be particularly active. Attire for the day should lean toward layers, with a warm jacket advisable to keep comfortable against the cool breeze. Considering the seasonal context, temperatures are typical for early December in the region, hinting at the deepening winter. Outdoor activities might focus on brisk walks along the beach or enjoying the scenery, but anyone venturing out should prepare for the chill, especially as darkness approaches.",
