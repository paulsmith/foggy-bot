    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current conditions radiate a crisp chill, with the temperature hovering in the mid-20s accompanied by a brisk, howling wind that makes it feel even colder. The sky presents a partly cloudy canvas, allowing moments of fleeting sunlight that barely warm the air. As for the waves along Lake Michigan, expect them to be a bit turbulent due to the gusty winds, stirring the waters into a lively dance.\n\nLooking ahead, this afternoon is expected to remain partly sunny, with temperatures gently falling to around the mid-20s, while the wind shifts to a gentler northwest breeze. Tonight, the skies will turn partly cloudy, making for an ideal evening to stay cozy indoors or take a brisk walk, as temperatures dip to the low teens. No significant precipitation is expected, keeping the atmosphere dry, but dress warmly to combat the cold and wind chill. Given that it\u2019s early December, the current temperatures are typical for this time of year in the Midwest, so expect the usual winter attire of heavy coats and warm accessories. With the sun setting early, it\u2019s a good opportunity for indoor activities or gathering with friends for the upcoming holidays.",
