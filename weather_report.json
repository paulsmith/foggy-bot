    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently enveloped in a cool embrace, with temperatures hovering in the low 50s and humidity creating a slightly damp air. A light drizzle accompanies the scene, contributing to a foggy atmosphere that obscures the shoreline view of Lake Michigan. Wind gusts are picking up, bringing an invigorating but chilly breeze from the southeast, stirring up the waters and enhancing the moody maritime backdrop.\n\nAs the night progresses, expect the rain to intensify, with heavier showers likely overnight. The temperature is anticipated to dip slightly before rising again, urging residents to bundle up a bit more as the wind shifts to a gentle westward breeze on Thursday. The high is projected to be near the mid-50s, and while rain showers are still likely, overall conditions will remain damp and cloudy. Given the autumn season, this weather is typical for the time of year, but it might feel uncomfortably wet when venturing outdoors. For those looking to enjoy the shoreline, it might be best to postpone any activities until the weather clears up or choose indoor pursuits like visiting local cafes or museums, where you can stay warm and dry.",
