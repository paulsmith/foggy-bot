    "weather_report": "As we step into this early February afternoon in Evanston, the temperature rests in the mid 20s, offering a well-chilled atmosphere that is accentuated by a damp coolness in the air. The sky hangs low, cloaked in clouds, subtly hinting at the possibility of light snow showers later. While the day may be cloudy, the piercing chill provides a refreshing bite that reminds us the season is still very much winter. Wave conditions on Lake Michigan are moderately active, reflecting the gusty northeast winds that will emerge as the day progresses, potentially reaching speeds of 10 to 15 mph.\n\nThe forecast suggests a chance of snow showers this afternoon, but the expected accumulation will likely be light, as the chances for persistent precipitation remain low. For the evening, temperatures will hover around the mid 20s but are expected to rise slightly overnight, providing a whisper of warmth amid the continuing cloudiness. With these conditions in mind, it's advisable to dress warmly\u2014layers, a sturdy coat, and a hat will provide the necessary comfort to navigate this brisk day. Given the chilly and slightly dreary weather, outdoor activities may be best reserved for those eager to enjoy a brisk walk along the beach or moments by the water's edge, taking in the stark beauty of winter\u2019s grip on the Great Lakes.",
