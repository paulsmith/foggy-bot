    "weather_report": "A tranquil afternoon embraces Evanston, as the sun casts a gentle glow over the beach and Lake Michigan. With temperatures reaching around 51 degrees, the day has been pleasantly mild, softened by a light east-northeast breeze. As dusk approaches, the sky remains mostly clear, hinting at a serene evening ahead with lows anticipated around 44 degrees.\n\nThe waves, though not tumultuous, reveal a subtle dance as they lap gently against the shore, reflecting the evening light in a soothing array of blues and greens. The air is dry, and no precipitation seems imminent, making it an ideal time to enjoy a serene stroll along the sandy expanses or perhaps engage in a quiet moment of reflection positioned on one of the nearby benches. Given the seasonal chill, layering with a light jacket would be wise, providing comfort against the coolness of the approaching night. With this lovely stretch of time following Halloween, one might even find the lingering spirit of the festivities echoing in the laughter of families enjoying the crisp fall air.",
