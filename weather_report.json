    "weather_report": "As evening descends upon Evanston, the temperature sits comfortably in the upper 40s, accompanied by a dampness in the air that hints at the impending precipitation. The winds howl from the southeast at a brisk pace, creating a blustery atmosphere along the shoreline as clouds cloak the sky, lending a moody, gray tone to the scenery. Expect patchy drizzle this evening, ebbing after 10 PM, followed by scattered rain showers that could linger into the night. The low will hover around the mid 40s as the refreshing chill settles in.\n\nLooking ahead to Monday, drizzle may greet early risers before the day transitions to scattered rain showers, with temperatures peaking in the low 50s but gradually falling as the afternoon progresses. The west-southwest winds will remain lively, whipping through the area with gusts that may reach a vigorous 30 mph, so prepare for a distinct chill as you venture outdoors. Given these wet and blustery conditions, dressing in layers, including a waterproof jacket and sturdy footwear, is advisable for anyone planning to brave the elements. While the temperature may feel slightly cooler than typical for late November, it offers a stark reminder of winter's approach, making this a good day for indoor activities or perhaps a short walk if you're feeling adventurous as waves lap gently against the shore, providing a serene backdrop amidst the stormy skies.",
