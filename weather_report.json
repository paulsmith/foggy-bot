    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly and cloudy afternoon, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s and a strong, blustery wind sweeping in from the west. The beach, usually a tranquil retreat, today bears the touch of winter's chill, preparing for potential snowfall later in the day. The forecast indicates a 40% chance of snow after 4 PM, with blustery conditions continuing, making it feel even colder as the day progresses.\n\nAs night falls, expect temperatures to dip into the teens, while the humidity adds a biting edge to the air. With a 50% chance of light snow before 9 PM, conditions may not be ideal for outdoor activities. The lake mirrors the overcast sky, reflecting a muted palette that matches the crisp season. For those venturing outside, bundling up in layers is essential\u2014think heavy coats, scarves, and perhaps gloves to keep warm against the relentless breeze. The ongoing winter season lends a familiar chill, typical of Illinois in January, so this weather fits right into the seasonal rhythm. While the beach may not be bustling with summer activities, it offers a serene backdrop for a brisk winter walk or a moment to observe the beauty of nature\u2019s quiet rest.",
