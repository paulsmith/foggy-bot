    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the air feels brisk and cool this early morning, with a current temperature in the low 40s and a noticeable chill brought on by gusty winds from the west-northwest. The sky hangs heavily with clouds, creating a moody atmosphere that hints at a somewhat dreary day ahead. As we look to the forecast, temperatures are expected to hover around the mid 30s later today, with a relentless overcast that will keep spirits grounded. The wind, though not fierce, will bring a chill as it lingers around 10 mph, making for a blustery experience when outdoors.\n\nAs for the lake, wave conditions may be mildly stirred, but precipitation isn\u2019t expected in the coming hours; rather, we can anticipate an absence of sun\u2014certainly no opportunity for warmth or brightness. Attire should lean toward layers; a warm coat, perhaps a hat to shield against the cold winds, and sturdy footwear to tackle any slippery spots. It\u2019s a day typical for early December in this region, where the temperature is comfortably cool but indicative of the frigid months to come. Opportunities for outdoors are slim, though a brisk walk along the lakeshore or a visit to local caf\u00e9s may serve as a pleasant escape from the chilly air. Enjoy the quiet of a winter\u2019s night as the holiday season approaches, with major celebrations just around the corner.",
