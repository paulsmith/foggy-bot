    "weather_report": "As the morning unfolds in Evanston, the atmosphere hangs heavy with a cool, damp energy, reflecting the current temperature in the low 60s. With overcast skies dominating the skyline, it feels slightly muggy, reminiscent of a late autumn day that struggles to cast the brightness of summer aside. Today's forecast holds a slight possibility of rain showers before 9 AM, though the chances are minimal. Expect mostly cloudy skies throughout the day, with temperatures sliding back into the mid-50s by afternoon. Winds from the southwest are set to pick up, creating a breezy, almost invigorating chill that could stir the leaves along the beach.\n\nAs evening approaches, the forecast indicates another slim chance of showers post 3 AM, but nothing substantial is anticipated. The evening will bring a cooling trend with temperatures dipping to the low 40s, offering a crisp and refreshing night ahead. For outdoor enthusiasts, though the cloud cover may dim the allure of sunbathing by the lake, it's an ideal time for brisk walks along the beach or enjoying the beauty of the shoreline with a warm jacket and perhaps a cozy scarf. Given that this is mid-November, these temperatures fall nicely within seasonal expectations for the region, making it a typical fall day in the Midwest.",
