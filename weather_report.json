    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly evening with temperatures hovering in the mid-30s, offering a brisk sensation enhanced by a gusty southwest breeze. The weather is predominantly cloudy, creating a dim ambiance as nightfall settles. Looking ahead, tonight brings a slight possibility of snow during the early morning hours, although any accumulation is expected to be minimal. As we transition into Wednesday, conditions will remain mostly cloudy with daytime highs peaking in the mid-40s before easing back down in the afternoon.\n\nThe atmosphere is characterized by a rather stark chill typical for late November, making it feel a bit colder than the numbers suggest due to the blustery winds. As for the lake, wave conditions will likely be moderate, reflecting the ongoing wind patterns. It\u2019s advisable to dress warmly, opting for layered clothing to stay comfortable when venturing outdoors. Given these conditions, this evening might not be suitable for outdoor activities, but indoor options or brief walks along the beach could provide some fresh air without too much discomfort. There are no significant holidays to note at this moment, but the holiday season is just around the corner, setting the stage for upcoming celebrations.",
