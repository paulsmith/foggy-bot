    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly night, with temperatures settling in the upper 40s and a gentle breeze whispering in from the south. The air carries a slightly damp coolness, indicative of a mostly cloudy sky overhead. As the evening deepens, there's a slight chance of rain showers overnight as temperatures dip to the mid 40s. \n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, expect a similar theme of cloudiness throughout the day. A slight chance of rain lingers as daytime highs reach for the low 60s before falling back into the upper 50s by the afternoon. Winds will shift to a light southwest flow, ideal for a brisk walk along the shore, although occasional gusts could bring a bit of chill. With wave conditions likely to be moderate along Lake Michigan, it may not be the best day for boating, but plenty of opportunities exist for enjoying a peaceful stroll on the beach or perhaps visiting a local caf\u00e9 instead. Given that this is November, the current temperature is typical for the season, and those planning to venture outdoors should layer up, opting for a light jacket or sweater to stay comfortably warm.",
