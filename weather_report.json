    "weather_report": "As the clock ticks past 11 PM in Evanston, the chill of late November is palpable, with temperatures dipping into the upper teens. The atmosphere is crisp and clear, a stark contrast to the howling winds that sweep through the area, momentarily rattling any exposed fixtures along the shoreline. This evening, conditions remain dry, with no signs of precipitation to dampen the mood. \n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the sun will grace us with its presence, warming the day slightly into the low 20s, though wind chill will make it feel a few degrees colder. The winds, while still brisk, will quiet down to a gentler pace, making outdoor ventures a bit more bearable. Given the season, this weather is typical for late fall in the Midwest, where winter's chill is just beginning to settle in. Those venturing out should bundle up; layers are advisable, with warm hats and gloves essential to fend off the cold. Despite the frigid conditions, tomorrow presents a great opportunity for brisk walks along the lakefront, where the calming sound of the waves may provide a tranquil backdrop amidst the brisk air.",
