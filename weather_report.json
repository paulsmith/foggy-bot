    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly night, with temperatures hovering in the mid teens, enveloped in a blanket of cloud cover. A gentle yet brisk wind from the northwest adds a stark bite to the air, making it feel even cooler as dusk deepens. The beach scene is somber\u2014still and quiet, present only to the long streets and the waters of Lake Michigan, reflecting eerily against the night sky. As we look ahead to tomorrow, a slight chance of snow showers threatens what promises to be a mostly cloudy day. With highs reaching the upper 20s, the temperatures will drop slightly in the afternoon. Those venturing out will find it advisable to dress in warm layers to stave off the chill, especially considering the gusty winds that may emanate from the west.\n\nThe weather during this late fall season is typical for the area, with temperatures leaning towards the colder end of the spectrum. As the weekend unfolds, festive spirits will soon be summoned with the arrival of the holidays, though today does not stand out for any particular celebration. For outdoor enthusiasts, this might not be ideal for extended fun by the lake, but cozying up in a local caf\u00e9 with a warm beverage or enjoying a quick stroll around may suffice for those wishing to savor the atmosphere.",
