    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a brisk and chilly atmosphere, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s, while the air carries a damp chill from the east, creating a slightly dreary yet calm scene. The skies are predominantly overcast, with a notable breeze adding a touch of wind to the mix as it sweeps across the beach towards Lake Michigan. As evening falls and the temperature settles around the mid-30s, tonight will bring cloudy skies with light winds, inviting a cozy indoor evening.\n\nLooking forward to the next day, Christmas Day is set to continue the cloudy trend, presenting a slight chance of drizzle after noon. Expect temperatures to peak near the upper 30s, with gentle easterly winds contributing to a persistent chill in the air. While wave conditions along the lakeshore may be moderately active, with whitecaps forming under the brisk wind, outdoor activities might be limited. Attire should include warm layers, perhaps a good winter coat, hat, and gloves to combat the penetrating coolness typical of a Chicago winter. Given that tomorrow is Christmas, it's an ideal time for indoor gatherings, celebrating with loved ones in warmth, or perhaps enjoying local holiday events under the evening lights.",
