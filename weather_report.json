    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently enveloped in a cloudy and crisp atmosphere as temperatures hover in the high 30s. The air feels invigoratingly cool, accentuated by a fierce wind sweeping across the beach, making the day feel quite brisk. While there is no significant precipitation on the horizon, the gusty conditions combined with the overcast sky present a scene that might be perceived as rather dreary at first glance. However, the waves of Lake Michigan churn gently, reflecting a vibrant yet subtle energy, inviting sturdy souls who wish to embrace the elements.\n\nLooking ahead, the day promises mostly cloudy skies, with a high temperature peaking in the low 40s. This is typical for late November in the Midwest, where the transition into winter brings a noticeable chill. Attire should lean towards warm and layered clothing, perhaps a cozy jacket or a thick sweater, especially with the wind chill adding a bite to the air. Outdoor activities may be best enjoyed in brief bursts\u2014perhaps a quick stroll along the beach or a brisk walk through a nearby park to appreciate the seasonal changes, but prepare to retreat indoors for warmth soon after.",
