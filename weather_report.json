    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently gripped in the chill of early December, with temperatures hovering in the low teens. The atmosphere is brisk, accompanied by a blustery wind that cuts through the air, making it feel much colder than it is. Under clear skies, there's a certain starkness to the landscape, with the beach extending into the dark waters of Lake Michigan. However, this frigid display is a fleeting moment as we turn our attention to a forecast that promises occasional snow showers overnight, giving way to a mix of sun and clouds during the day. Daytime highs will creep into the upper 20s, but the persistent wind chill will certainly remind residents of winter's presence, with wind gusts bringing sharp, uncomfortable sensations.\n\nFor those contemplating outdoor activities, it's advisable to bundle up thoroughly; heavy coats, scarves, and warm hats are essential to brave the elements. Wave conditions along the lake may become choppy with the boost from the wind, potentially making for a dramatic scene but not ideal for leisurely strolls along the beach. While the holidays are still a few weeks away, today reminds us of the season's touch, conjuring thoughts of winter festivities and cozy gatherings indoors.",
