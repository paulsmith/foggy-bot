    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois, reveal a chilliness in the air, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s, accompanied by a mostly cloudy sky. Wind is calm, offering little distraction from the coolness that seeps into the bones. As the afternoon unfolds, expect a transition to mostly sunny skies, though temperatures may struggle to climb, peaking just below freezing. This evening introduces a chance of light snow into the mix, particularly after 3 AM, set against a backdrop of a mostly cloudy night and a low dipping into the low 20s, with a light southwest breeze stirring occasionally.\n\nToday\u2019s uninviting weather makes outdoor plans a little less appealing, though the scene might be tranquil for short walks along the beach, where the wintry air meets the chilly waters of Lake Michigan. Given the current season, these persistent cool temperatures are characteristic of February in this region. Dress warmly\u2014layered attire, a heavy coat, gloves, and perhaps a snug scarf will be essential for venturing outside. Given the light chance of snow tonight, those with evening plans might consider being prepared for a brief flurry. In this time of year, as the heart of winter settles in, the beauty of Evanston\u2019s lakeshore persists, even if today\u2019s weather might chill the more adventurous spirits.",
