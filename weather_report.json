    "weather_report": "In Evanston, current conditions present a brisk and slightly biting atmosphere with temperatures hovering in the low 30s. The air carries a notable chill, enhanced by a blustery wind blowing from the west, stirring up the waters of Lake Michigan. The day is predominantly overcast, leaving a dreary impression as thick clouds blanket the sky, hinting at the potential for further precipitation.\n\nLooking ahead, the forecast is set to unfold a wintry scene tonight, with temperatures dipping to the upper 20s. As the night progresses, the air will remain stagnant yet steadily cool. Tomorrow brings a chance of snow and freezing drizzle primarily during the late morning, transitioning into a day filled with cloud cover and a high nearing the mid-30s. This forecast suggests that tomorrow\u2019s conditions may also contribute to slippery surfaces, urging caution for any outdoor plans. For those braving the outdoors, dressing warmly in layers, with a sturdy coat and winter accessories like gloves and hats, will be essential to navigate this wintry backdrop. Despite the cold, this time of year is typical for the region, making bundled-up walks along the lakeshore or short outings quite fitting for the season.",
