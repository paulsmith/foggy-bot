    "weather_report": "As evening settles in Evanston, the conditions are decidedly brisk and damp, with temperatures hovering in the mid-30s, complemented by a thick blanket of fog and mist. A gentle breeze from the east adds a chill to the air as residents navigate the muted visibility along the waterfront. The beach scene, usually vibrant, is subdued under the wispy haze, with only the sound of the waves gently crashing against the shore punctuating the quiet. \n\nLooking ahead to Thursday, the morning will see persistent fog and patchy drizzle, slowly giving way to cloudy skies that may offer little reprieve from the humidity. Highs will creep into the mid-40s, characteristic of a late December day in the Midwest, but still a touch below the seasonal average. The wave conditions will remain moderate, and any outdoor activities should be approached with caution; a warm, waterproof jacket and sturdy shoes are recommended for anyone venturing out. As this day coincides with the festive spirit of Christmas, it's an opportune moment to enjoy cozy indoor gatherings, reflect on the holiday, or perhaps take a brisk walk along the beach\u2014keeping warm and dry is key amidst the chilly air.",
