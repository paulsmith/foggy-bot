    "weather_report": "Evanston\u2019s morning air feels damp and cool, with temperatures hovering in the upper 40s. A thick layer of fog blankets the area, casting a gray shadow over the beach and obscuring distant views of Lake Michigan. The gentle but steady breezes, coming in from the southeast, bring a chill that makes the day feel distinctly brisk. Clouds gather ominously overhead as the forecast predicts a shift to rain showers, predominantly in the latter part of the day. By afternoon, temperatures are expected to rise to nearly the upper 50s, but existing conditions may render the experience less than pleasant, especially with a high likelihood of precipitation.\n\nAs the day progresses, expect heavy showers and possibly even thunderstorms rolling in this evening, accompanied by gusty winds reaching up to 25 mph. Wave conditions along the lake may be stirred up due to this wind, which could present some challenges for any daring early morning beachgoers or fishermen. Given the wet forecast and dense cloud cover, dressing in layers with a waterproof jacket and sturdy shoes would be wise for anyone venturing outdoors. The current conditions are typical for mid-November in the Chicago area, where cool, damp days are part of the seasonal transition into winter. Activities may be limited due to the weather; indoor pursuits, such as visiting local cafes or museums, could provide warmth and refuge until conditions improve.",
