    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather presents a rather murky scene, with temperatures in the low 40s, accompanied by a moist chill that clings to the air. A gentle breeze flows in from the south at around 12 miles per hour, adding a slight edge to the damp conditions, while persistent drizzle creates a soft curtain of gray across the landscape. The visibility is significantly reduced, making for a somewhat dreary atmosphere along the shoreline.\n\nAs we move into the day, expect the visibility to remain limited with areas of fog lingering and a slight chance of rain showers. Clouds will dominate the sky, keeping temperatures steady, peaking in the high 40s before slipping back into the low 40s by the afternoon. With the wave conditions likely moderate from the ongoing drizzle and the gentle winds, those looking to venture out might find the environment rather uninviting. Recommended attire would include a waterproof jacket and perhaps a warm layer beneath, to combat the damp chill in the air. \n\nConsidering it's mid-December, these conditions align with the typical chill of the season here in the Midwest, embodying that classic wintry feel. Outdoor activities may be limited, but the cozy respite of cafes or art galleries would offer a warm reprieve from the weather. Today is also a non-holiday Saturday, providing a chance for locals to enjoy a subdued weekend while staying dry and warm indoors.",
