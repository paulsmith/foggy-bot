    "weather_report": "The current weather in Evanston paints a rather somber scene, with a temperature in the mid-60s and thick clouds hovering overhead. Humidity levels are high, creating a muggy atmosphere, while the absence of wind leaves the air feeling still and heavy. The beach, usually a vibrant escape, appears subdued under the gray skies. As we look ahead, expect rain showers to sweep in this afternoon, with temperatures dipping slightly as they hover around the low 60s. Strong southwesterly winds will stir things up, gusting to nearly 40 miles per hour, adding a lively contrast to the otherwise restrained environment. Tonight, scattered showers may linger into the evening, with a brief reprieve leading to mostly cloudy skies and temperatures settling into the low 50s.\n\nWith precipitation likely this afternoon and wave conditions gently undulating along Lake Michigan, outdoor plans may need to shift indoors. The recommendation for attire is layered and waterproof, suitable for navigating both the dampness and the brisk winds. While the weather might not inspire a leisurely stroll along the water, cozying up with a good book or visiting a local caf\u00e9 could be delightful alternatives. In November, with temperatures typical for the season around this time, the mood leans towards a crisp autumn ambience, inviting a reflective pause rather than the usual basking in the sun.",
