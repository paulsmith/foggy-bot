    "weather_report": "This evening in Evanston, temperatures are hovering in the mid-20s, imbued with a chill that feels more piercing due to the gusty winds sweeping in from the east. The light snow and mist create a damp, murky atmosphere, with visibility likely reduced as flurries continue to fall, setting the stage for a bitter night ahead. The forecast signals approaching snowfall that will blanket the region under a fresh layer of white, with an expected low in the teens and wind gusts potentially reaching 25 mph, adding to the overall discomfort. \n\nAs the night progresses, expect a cold and blustery scene along the lakefront, where waves may churn restlessly amid the snowfall. Individuals considering venturing outdoors should think warmly, equipped with insulated coats, scarves, and sturdy footwear to navigate the snowy terrain. While winter sports enthusiasts might find the conditions favorable for some light activities, the biting cold and wind may deter most casual outings. As this is a regular weekday, it might be wise to stay indoors, perhaps enjoying a warm drink while the winter transforms the landscape outside into a picturesque but harsh scene.",
