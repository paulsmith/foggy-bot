    "weather_report": "Under the night sky, Evanston finds itself in crisp and cool conditions, with current temperatures hovering in the lower 20s and a refreshing breeze kicking up from the west. The air feels invigorating, perfect for a late-night stroll or a quick jog along the lakefront, provided you bundle up; a warm coat, hat, and gloves will ensure comfort against the gusty winds. Tonight offers pleasantly clear skies, allowing the stars to shine brightly, laying a serene blanket over the town.\n\nAs we look towards Monday, expect a transition to mostly sunny skies throughout the day as temperatures climb into the mid 40s, making way for a lively, somewhat blustery atmosphere. Winds will persist\u2014lively and gusty\u2014creating a vigorous chill that may have you thinking twice about outdoor plans unless you\u2019re well-prepared with layers. The wave conditions will likely be energetic along the shoreline due to the winds, though no additional precipitation is in sight. Overall, stay warm while enjoying the beauty of winter\u2019s offerings, bearing in mind that these temperatures are fairly typical for this time of year in the Midwest.",
