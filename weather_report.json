    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the morning brings a stark chill, with temperatures hovering in the low teens, showcasing a brisk and biting air that feels even colder with the aggressive gusts sweeping in from the northwest. The sky is primarily clear, allowing sunlight to break through but hinting at the occasional snow flurry that may flutter down before noon. While those preparing for the day might find the scene to be beautiful in its starkness, the fierce winds create a jarring atmosphere, making it feel quite inhospitable for long outdoor ventures.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect occasional scattered snow showers giving way to a mostly sunny sky, with temperatures reaching a high around the upper 20s. The lake, complemented by blustery winds and moderate wave conditions, makes this a day more suited for indoor activities. A wind chill dipping close to zero will likely urge residents to bundle up. Wear insulated clothing, a warm hat, and gloves if venturing outside. This is typical December weather in the Midwest, reflecting the deep chill associated with this season. Given the conditions, it might be best to enjoy cozy indoor pastimes such as reading by the fire or perhaps visiting local shops, keeping warm while watching the winter wonderland transform outside.",
