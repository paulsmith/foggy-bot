    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois, reveal a chilly morning with temperatures hovering in the low 30s. The atmosphere is noticeably damp, contributing to a distinctly crisp feel as a fierce wind sweeps through the area at nearly 50 mph. The cloud cover adds to the somber ambiance, hinting at impending precipitation. Today's forecast predicts heavy snowfall earlier in the day, transitioning to a mix of rain and snow, with the high reaching into the low 40s. Expect significant accumulations, making the cityscape turn white, particularly as gusty winds threaten to whip any loose flakes around.\n\nAs the day unfolds, it may not be the most inviting scene for outdoor activities, given the blustery winds and the potential for wet conditions. The waves on Lake Michigan will likely be rough, so beachgoers should avoid venturing into the water. For those who must be outdoors, bundling up in warm layers and grabbing waterproof gear will be crucial to staying comfortable. Although the date itself isn\u2019t marked by a major holiday, the atmospheric drama does set the stage for a classic winter day in the Midwest. Plan to stay indoors, perhaps warming up with a hot beverage and a good book as the storm rolls in.",
