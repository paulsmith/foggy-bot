    "weather_report": "In Evanston, temperatures are currently hovering in the low 30s, creating a chilly atmosphere that feels distinctly crisp against the breeze. There's a robust wind, adding a bite to the air, and the sky is draped in a thick layer of clouds. Tonight, expect freezing drizzle before daybreak, with temperatures slipping just below freezing, then gradually rising to the low 30s as the night progresses. Winds will calm somewhat, shifting to a gentler breeze from the south, yet a notable chance of precipitation looms at 80%. \n\nTomorrow, conditions will brighten significantly, revealing mostly sunny skies and temperatures climbing to the high 30s by the afternoon. Given the winter season, these temperatures are typical for this time of year. The beach may appear uninviting given the current weather, but tomorrow\u2019s clearer skies will allow for more appealing outdoor activities. Dress warmly, donning layers and a sturdy jacket to combat the chill and the dampness expected tonight. The forecast suggests minimal ice accumulation, yet some caution is advised if venturing out near the water.",
