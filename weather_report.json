    "weather_report": "The current weather in Evanston, Illinois, reveals a day that's feeling brisk and damp with blustery winds. At this hour, temperatures are in the low 50s, contributing to an overall cool experience as the air wraps around you with a slight chill. The sky is adorned with clouds, casting a muted light over the beach as gentle waves lap at the shore, offering a serene view of Lake Michigan. \n\nAs we look ahead, the forecast indicates a moderate increase in temperatures this afternoon, peaking in the high 50s, but the chill will remain as winds shift to a west-southwest direction and continue to puff with strength. There is a slight chance of rain showers later in the day, particularly after 4 PM, so those with outdoor plans should remain mindful. This evening, expect conditions to be partly cloudy, cooling down to the mid 40s, making it feel rather crisp again. Given the weather, layers are advisable \u2013 a warm jacket coupled with a lightweight scarf may keep you comfortable in the cooler air. These conditions are typical for this time of year in the Midwest, as we transition through the fall, where the coolness is often accompanied by overcast skies. Despite the chill, the beach remains a lovely spot for a quiet stroll; just remember to keep an eye on the sky for potential showers.",
