    "weather_report": "As evening settles over Evanston, the air is crisp and cool with a temperature hovering in the mid-30s, complementing the thick overcast skies. Conditions are calm for the moment, though winter is making its presence felt. With snow forecasted to begin after midnight, there\u2019s an anticipatory chill in the breeze, stirring the lake's surface just enough to whisper of the coming precipitation. This evening's outlook is marked by clouds and the likelihood of light snowfall, with just a hint of wind forecasted to pick up, bringing an occasional gust.\n\nTomorrow promises a continuation of wintry conditions with a chance of morning flurries, giving way to a partly sunny afternoon but with temperatures continuing to dip, reaching around the low 30s. For those considering outdoor activities, layers will be essential: a warm coat, scarf, gloves, and a sturdy hat would serve well against the chill. While the waves along the lake may be slightly undulating, they are nothing fierce, inviting solitary walks but perhaps not much in the way of boating or leisurely beach outings. Notably, as we approach the festive season, the ambiance could transform into a winter wonderland, perfect for capturing the spirit of the holidays through local decor and light displays.",
