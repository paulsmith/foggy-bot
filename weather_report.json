    "weather_report": "As night envelops Evanston, the temperature hovers in the low 40s, presenting a crisp, cool atmosphere with a gentle breeze wafting from the north. The clear sky, unmarred by clouds this evening, promises an unobstructed view of the stars above, but there's an inkling of change coming as late-night hours approach. A slight chance of rain showers is expected after 3 AM, adding a whisper of uncertainty to the otherwise tranquil evening.\n\nLooking ahead to Tuesday, expect a transition into mostly sunny skies, with temperatures reaching the high 40s during the day. While the delightful sunshine will enhance the scenery along the beach, a gentle east wind will keep things feeling brisk. The probability of precipitation remains low for the day, allowing for outdoor activities aimed at soaking in the last vestiges of autumn. Given the current season, the temperatures are typical for mid-November in this region, where the cool air commands a layer or two for comfort. Ideal attire would include a warm jacket, perhaps a scarf, especially as evening descends and temperatures dip. Those looking to enjoy the shoreline should consider a stroll along the beach, taking in the serenity of the lake, or perhaps engage in a well-deserved coffee break at a nearby caf\u00e9, soaking up the pleasant yet brisk day ahead.",
