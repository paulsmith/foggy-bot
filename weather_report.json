    "weather_report": "In Evanston, conditions are currently brisk and chilly, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s. The air feels rather damp, accentuated by the gray, partly cloudy sky, setting a somewhat somber winter atmosphere. Snow is expected to make an appearance this afternoon, with a high reaching around 35 degrees, then gradually dropping to the upper teens tonight. Expect a steady north-northwest wind, adding a blustery chill, particularly during any gusts that may reach up to 35 mph.\n\nWith a 70% chance of snow this afternoon, it is wise to prepare for slippery conditions, especially as light accumulation is anticipated. Later, scattered snow showers will give way to a partly cloudy night, enhancing the cool and crisp feel of the evening. Lake Michigan may exhibit some fresh waves today, providing a dramatic backdrop as the clouds roll in, but the conditions will not be ideal for swimming or other water activities. Instead, warm layers and waterproof attire are recommended if venturing outside, particularly for those walking near the beach or attending to outdoor tasks. Given the winter season, this temperature is typical for the region, so bundle up and enjoy some cozy indoor activities as the holiday season draws near.",
