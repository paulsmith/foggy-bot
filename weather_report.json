    "weather_report": "Currently, Evanston experiences brisk conditions with a temperature in the low 50s, accompanied by a slightly muggy feel due to the humidity hovering around 66%. The sky is cloaked in a thick blanket of clouds, presenting a rather muted appearance to the day. Winds are strong, blowing in from the southeast at a fierce pace, creating a notable chill as they sweep across the lakefront. \n\nLooking ahead, today's forecast reveals more clouds with temperatures peaking near the mid-50s before dipping slightly in the afternoon. A slight chance of rain showers is expected late tonight, particularly after 3 AM, suggesting some dampness ahead. With a 20% chance of precipitation, outdoor activities may need to be adjusted depending on the timing. Given these conditions, it's advisable to dress in layers, including a light jacket to guard against the wind and potential evening showers. Seasonally, this weather aligns with typical mid-November patterns in the Midwest, though the wind has a more pronounced effect than usual for this time of year. It may be an opportune time for a brisk walk along the lake, perhaps offering moments of solitude to appreciate the serene yet somber beauty of the cloudy shoreline.",
