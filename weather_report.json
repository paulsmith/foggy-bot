    "weather_report": "The current weather in Evanston, Illinois, presents a brisk and chilly atmosphere, with temperatures hovering in the mid 15s, complemented by a significant wind that is quite gusty, making it feel even cooler. Conditions remain clear, granting a bright start to the day, though the cold might deter some from venturing out. As we progress into the day, expect mostly sunny skies with temperatures rising to around the mid 20s, followed by a gradual decline into the evening when it will dip to the low teens, with wind chills dropping significantly, potentially feeling like zero.\n\nWave conditions along the lake are mild, as there are no indications of precipitation; however, the breeze arranges gentle ripples across the surface. Given the chill in the air and the persistent gusts, this is an ideal day for bundled-up walks along the shore or cozy indoor activities. Attire should focus on warmth, with layered clothing, gloves, and hats highly recommended to combat the penetrating cold, particularly if you're aiming to watch the sun set over the water this evening. As we enter December, this weather aligns closely with seasonal expectations for the region, creating typical winter conditions in the Midwest, perfect for enjoying the last stretches of fall scenery before deep winter sets in.",
