    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly, brisk atmosphere with temperatures hovering in the low teens, presenting a distinctly wintry feel characteristic of December. The sky is mostly clear, illuminated by a faint early morning light, though the air carries a biting edge that might encourage one to bundle up. Tonight, occasional snow showers are likely, accompanied by strong northwesterly winds that will bring wind chill values plummeting to around -4, making it important to dress warmly in layers, perhaps with a durable winter coat, gloves, and a hat.\n\nAs we step into Thursday, expect more snow showers in the morning transitioning to mostly sunny skies, though the temperatures are predicted to rise only slightly to the upper 20s, before settling back in the chilly mid-20s by the afternoon. Wave conditions on Lake Michigan might reflect a bit of agitation from the winds, making it less inviting for recreational activities but certainly picturesque. Given the seasonal chill and the scattered snow, today\u2019s landscape offers a wintry charm perfect for cozy indoor pursuits or brisk walks along the shore, reminding everyone of the serene beauty that winter in Evanston can provide.",
