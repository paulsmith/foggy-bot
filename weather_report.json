    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather presents a crisp chill, with temperatures hovering in the upper 20s and a prevailing wind that feels fierce out of the northwest. The day is mostly cloudy, lending a subdued atmosphere over the lakefront, where wave activity adds a dynamic, rolling motion to the scene. As evening approaches, a chance of light snow showers exists, particularly before 8 PM, accompanied by temperatures expected to dip to the low teens later tonight. With gusty winds expected, particularly this evening, conditions might feel even colder than the thermometer suggests.\n\nLooking ahead to Saturday, expect a brightening sky with mostly sunny conditions taking over, but don\u2019t expect much warmth as the high struggles to reach the mid 20s. This temperature trend is consistent with typical winter weather for this time of year in the Midwest, where the mercury reliably falls. Given the chilly and potentially breezy nature, layered, warm attire is advised\u2014think heavy coats, gloves, and perhaps a hat to shield from the cutting wind. The beach might not be the first choice of destination, but bundled walks along the lakefront could offer a refreshing winter experience for those adventurous enough to embrace the season. This period leading up to the holidays invites a cozy atmosphere, perfect for warming up indoors with friends or family as celebrations draw closer.",
