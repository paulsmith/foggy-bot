    "weather_report": "Evanston awakens to a brisk morning with current temperatures hovering in the upper 20s, creating a cold yet refreshing start to the day. The air is still, though the winds from the west are beginning to rise, hinting at a blustery day ahead. Conditions are clear, presenting a beautiful view of Lake Michigan, although the chilly breeze may require a warm jacket or layers for those venturing outdoors. Despite the delightful clarity, the temperature feels quite nippy, typical for this time of year in late November.\n\nAs we move through the day, expect bright sunshine to prevail, with high temperatures reaching into the upper 30s, before cooling to the mid to upper 30s in the afternoon. The winds will remain noticeable, transitioning to a gentle yet cool breeze. Good news for beachcombers; wave conditions should be manageable without any precipitation expected throughout the day. Be prepared for the weather with hats and mittens while enjoying outdoor activities such as a brisk walk along the lakefront or a visit to nearby parks. As the holiday season approaches, keep in mind the festive spirit that permeates this chilly backdrop, perfect for hot cocoa afterward.",
