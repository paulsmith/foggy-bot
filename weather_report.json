    "weather_report": "In Evanston today, residents are facing a brisk scene, with temperatures hovering in the low 20s and a formidable wind that adds a bite to the air. Currently, light snow is descending, adding a soft blanket to the already cool landscape. The sky is overcast, casting a muted light over the beach, as the strong, gusty winds from the west whip across Lake Michigan, creating choppy conditions on the water. This afternoon, expect intermittent snow showers to continue, with a high near 26 degrees, only slightly above the current temperature. As evening falls, conditions will clear up, leading to a chilly night with lows dipping into the teens.\n\nGiven the chilly temperatures combined with the blustery winds, dressing warmly is essential\u2014think layers, thick coats, and insulated accessories to ward off the cold. The wave conditions today may be somewhat rough due to the winds, but those venturing out should be cautious. For outdoor enthusiasts, it's a good day for a brief winter walk along the beach or enjoying the scenic views, but be prepared for the possibility of light snow and a biting chill. As this is just after Thanksgiving, it might also evoke thoughts of holiday preparations in the coming weeks, with winter truly settling in across the region.",
