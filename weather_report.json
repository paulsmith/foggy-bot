    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the scene is brisk and overcast, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s and a notable wind creating a chilling atmosphere. Currently, it's cloudy with the gusts picking up, producing a fierce sensation for anyone venturing outside. As we look ahead, this afternoon holds a 50% chance of snow, accompanied by closely hovering temperatures around 32 degrees, eventually reaching a high near 34. The winds, blowing from the south-southeast, will bring a bit of warmth but still feel quite brisk due to their strength. \n\nTonight, an 80% likelihood of snow transforms into rain and snow after 1 AM, with temperatures gradually rising to approximately 33 degrees. As conditions shift, expect additional snow accumulation with little risk of ice. The beach may appear somewhat tumultuous with the wind stirring the waters, making for choppy waves. Dress warmly with layers to combat the chill and keep dry, as outdoor activities may be limited. Given the season, these temperatures are typical for mid-December in the Midwest. Although not a holiday, it offers a cozy setting for indoor gatherings or a peaceful evening by the fireplace, perhaps with a warm beverage in hand to ward off the winter bite.",
