    "weather_report": "As of now, Evanston's weather presents a cool and somewhat brisk atmosphere, with temperatures in the low 40s and a gentle breeze brushing in from the west-northwest. The air carries a slight chill, though it\u2019s not uncomfortably damp \u2014 ideal for bundling up in a light jacket to ward off the nippiness. The sky remains mostly cloudy, adding a muted brightness to the early morning hours, although visibility into the day ahead suggests the potential for scattered rain later.\n\nLooking ahead, a chance of rain showers looms before the morning light, tapering off into a mix of sun and clouds as the day progresses. Expect high temperatures to creep up to the upper 40s, though they may dip into the low 40s by afternoon. The wind is forecasted to pick up in intensity, becoming gusty at times, which could stir the waves along Lake Michigan, making for choppy conditions. Given these factors, dressing warmly and perhaps staying close to indoor activities may be prudent for those not relishing a brisk walk along the shore. With the approach of Thanksgiving in just a few days, there is an air of anticipation for families and friends gathering for the holiday festivities ahead.",
