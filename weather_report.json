    "weather_report": "As darkness envelops Evanston, the icy breath of winter is palpable, with temperatures hovering in the mid-20s and a chilling breeze sweeping in at a fierce pace. The air feels crisp and biting, evoking the unmistakable essence of a December night along the shores of Lake Michigan. Currently, it is mostly cloudy, creating a moody atmosphere as the waves crash gently onto the beach, stirred by robust winds from the east-southeast.\n\nLooking ahead, the weather is expected to remain predominantly overcast overnight, with temperatures nudging up slightly to the upper 20s. As Saturday unfolds, residents can anticipate a dreary day marked by a 60% chance of rain in the afternoon, as clouds linger and the temperature struggles to reach a high near 38 degrees. The combination of dampness and blustery winds will contribute to a decidedly uninviting outdoor experience. As the waves churn millpond-like beneath the darkened sky, it may be wise to bundle up in warm layers and waterproof attire if venturing outside. With such chilly conditions typical for this time of year in the Midwest, those seeking outdoor activities may want to reconsider, shifting their plans to cozy indoor pursuits instead, whether that be warming up with a cup of coffee or catching up on holiday shopping as the calendar inches closer to Christmas.",
