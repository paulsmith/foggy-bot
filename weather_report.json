    "weather_report": "Evanston's current weather paints a drizzly, cool scene as the temperature hovers in the low 50s. With the air feeling damp and a bouncy northern breeze whispering through, the day offers a cloudy sky that casts a grayish hue over the beach and Lake Michigan, contributing to an overall chilliness that might send most seeking out cozy layers. As we move into the forecast for the day, expect the clouds to remain steadfast, with afternoon temperatures dipping slightly toward the upper 40s. Drizzle is likely to linger, especially early on, though a more refreshing quietness may take over by noon. \n\nConditions along the beach are marked by modest wave action\u2014ideal for those who appreciate the scenic aspects of Lake Michigan but less favorable for swimming. The forecast indicates light precipitation, with patchy drizzle expected, adding to the dreariness. As for attire, it\u2019s best to reach for a warm jacket or a heavy sweater, complemented by a waterproof layer if venturing outdoors. The temperature, typical for mid-November in this region, invites indoor activities but doesn\u2019t entirely dismiss the appeal of a brisk stroll with a warm drink in hand. While today isn\u2019t a holiday, the onset of Thanksgiving in the coming week beckons warmer gatherings, making this weather a gentle reminder that winter is fast approaching.",
