    "weather_report": "Current weather in Evanston reveals a brisk, cloudy afternoon with temperatures hovering in the low 50s and a notable humidity that adds a slight chill to the air. The scene is marked by a blustery southeast wind, stirring the waters of Lake Michigan and causing gentle waves to lap at the shore. As the day progresses, the forecast indicates the likelihood of rain beginning after 5 PM, intensifying throughout the night with temperatures rising slightly to around the low 50s. With a 100% chance of precipitation and potential rainfall of up to an inch expected, it\u2019s wise to prepare for wet conditions.\n\nGiven the season, the current temperatures are rather typical for mid-November, although the weather feels more brisk and damp than refreshing. While outdoor activities may be curtailed due to the incoming rain, those keen on a leisurely stroll along the beach should be prepared for brisk winds and the impending downpour. Attire that includes a warm coat, sturdy shoes, and perhaps an umbrella or rain jacket is recommended to navigate the climate comfortably. As this day unfolds, it remains an ordinary but atmospheric November evening in Evanston, one where the sounds of the lake and the promise of rain create a reflective backdrop for residents.",
