    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the morning is marked by a particularly brisk chill, with a temperature hovering in the low single digits, and a wind that is both strong and relentless, creating an atmosphere that feels much colder. Current conditions are clear, allowing the sun to peek through, but with significant wind chill, it feels far more like a frosty winter's day than what the thermometer might suggest. The forecast points to a partly sunny day ahead, with a high expected to reach the low teens, but conditions will further drop to near-zero temperatures by evening, accompanied by a chilling breeze from the northwest.\n\nThe beach, typically a vibrant escape, is currently subdued under the weight of winter. Waves from Lake Michigan may be quite lively with the wind, but their movements contribute to a stark, rather than inviting, landscape. As precipitation is notably absent, it\u2019s a dry day, though the persistent cold makes outdoor activities less appealing. Layers are essential, and wearing a heavy coat, warm hat, and gloves is advisable to combat the biting cold. As this is Washington's Birthday, one might consider indoor celebrations or cozy gatherings to stay warm. Overall, today\u2019s weather is a reminder of the season\u2019s frigid grasp, and while the sun may shine intermittently, the chill in the air suggests a stay-close-to-home approach.",
