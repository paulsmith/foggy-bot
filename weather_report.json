    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current conditions are marked by a chilly demeanor, enveloped in a blanket of mostly cloudy skies with a gentle breeze stirring through the air. The temperature is hovering in the low 50s, creating a crisp environment that\u2019s likely to feel a bit nippy, especially as the evening progresses. As night falls, expect patchy fog and a fairly decent chance of rain, with temperatures dipping to around the low 40s. The air will gather a bit of warmth overnight, rising slightly to about 42 degrees with an easterly wind gently making its presence known.\n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, the scene shifts to one dominated by rain and lingering fog. The high temperature will reach the low 40s, but with a cold north wind whipping through at 10 to 15 mph, the day will feel decidedly chillier. With a near-guaranteed 90% chance of precipitation, it\u2019s vital to prepare for rainy conditions throughout the day. Given the overall gloomy atmosphere and potential for scattered showers along the beach, outdoor activities may be better suited for a cozy indoor environment. On this day, layering up with warm attire, perhaps a waterproof jacket, and sturdy footwear will help keep you comfortable against the impending rain and cool winds. \n\nWhether you're snuggled inside with a book or sipping a hot drink, embracing this winter ambiance could be quite enjoyable, despite the less than appealing weather. The scene at the beach will likely be one of restless waves and a shivering shoreline as Lake Michigan mirrors the cloudy heavens above.",
