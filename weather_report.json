    "weather_report": "As night settles over Evanston, current conditions hover in the low 30s, casting a chilly, brisk atmosphere across the beach. The biting wind howls from the west at a fierce pace, making the feel of the evening even colder, with light snow flurries dancing in the air, noticeably dampening visibility. A cloudy cover looms overhead, creating a somber palette as the waves of Lake Michigan build under the gusty winds, promising a blustery night ahead.\n\nLooking towards the forecast, scattered snow showers are expected to continue, with overnight lows dipping into the upper 20s. Tomorrow, residents can prepare for a day filled with snow transitioning to rain, complimented by strong winds that could reach near 45 mph. Accumulations of one to three inches are likely, turning the landscape into a winter wonderland before giving way to slush and puddles. Given the season, this cold is quite typical for late November, but the stormy weather may leave many reconsidering outdoor plans. As such, bundling up in warm, waterproof attire would be wise, especially for those braving the elements. With the holiday season approaching, tonight offers a quiet backdrop perfect for cozy indoor activities, perhaps with family or friends, away from the chill outside.",
