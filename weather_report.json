    "weather_report": "As we look over the shores of Lake Michigan in Evanston, current conditions paint a picture of briskness, with temperatures lingering in the low 50s, complemented by a blustery wind from the south that invigorates the atmosphere. The evening sky is draped in a shroud of clouds, creating a damp ambiance that hints at drizzle later tonight. With a chance of precipitation at 30%, residents may feel a touch of moisture in the air as they venture outside. \n\nExpect the weather to remain distinctly cool and somewhat unsettled as we transition into Monday, when cloud cover will disperse slightly, allowing for a mix of sun and temperatures that will hover near the mid 50s, subsequently dipping into the late afternoon. Given the wave conditions on the lake, gentle swells may be expected, offering a serene but somewhat uninviting sight on this chilly evening. Attire for tonight should emphasize warmth\u2014think jackets and scarves, particularly as temperatures head towards the mid 40s overnight. While this coolness is in line with seasonal expectations for December in the Midwest, the dampness may encourage indoor activities, like visiting local caf\u00e9s or enjoying an evening reading by the fire, as we move towards the festive season just days ahead.",
