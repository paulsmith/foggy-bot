    "weather_report": "This evening in Evanston, temperatures are falling into the low teens, creating a brisk atmosphere with a biting chill in the air, intensified by a fierce northwesterly wind. As the sun sets, the weather maintains a partly cloudy demeanor, offering a stark contrast to the biting cold and howling winds, driving the wind chill down to dangerously low levels around -5 degrees. \n\nLooking ahead to Saturday, clear skies promise a sunny respite, but do not let the brightness deceive you; it will remain chilly, with highs only reaching the low 20s, and wind chills remaining in the negative range. The waves from Lake Michigan are up, producing a slight swell along the shore, but no precipitation is anticipated, allowing for clarity in the environment. It's advisable to bundle up if venturing outdoors; heavy coats, scarves, and gloves are essential, as any exposed skin would feel the sting of the winter air. As we navigate this winter season, temperatures are indeed typical for Evanston, embracing the frosty character synonymous with January. Outdoor activities may be limited, but brisk walks along the lakefront could be invigorating for those prepared to face the elements.",
