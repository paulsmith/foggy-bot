    "weather_report": "As the clock ticks past three in the morning, Evanston wakes to a damp and dreary scene where light drizzle and fog cast a veil over the landscape. With temperatures lingering in the mid-30s, the air is chill and damp, creating a penetrative coolness that wraps around those venturing outside like a heavy blanket. The gentle but persistent breeze from the southeast whispers through the trees, adding a layer of chill to the already somber atmosphere.\n\nLooking ahead to the day, expect widespread drizzle and patchy fog to continue, with cloudy skies dominating the forecast. Slight warming will nudge temperatures toward the low 40s, though that won't bring much cheer as the day remains shrouded in cloud cover. A light breeze will complement the moist conditions, mingling with sporadic areas of fog that may obscure the view over Lake Michigan. Given these conditions, it\u2019s advisable to dress warmly with layers\u2014perhaps a waterproof jacket\u2014and sturdy footwear if walking near water, as surfaces may be slippery. Underfoot, the waves will likely be moderately stirred, due to the winds, creating an unpredictable shoreline. While today's weather lacks invitation, it is certainly a time for quiet reflection or snug indoor activities, as the seasonal chill and dampness are very much in line with a mid-December day in the Midwest.",
