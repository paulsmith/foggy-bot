    "weather_report": "The current weather in Evanston paints a scene of brisk, partly cloudy skies, with temperatures hovering in the low 40s and a notably blustery wind sweeping in from the west-northwest. As evening descends, conditions remain crisp and cool, perfect for those who favor the fresh air, though the breeze adds a sharp bite that suggests a warming layer might be wise if venturing outdoors. \n\nLooking ahead, tonight's forecast calls for mostly clear skies and a low nearing the upper 20s, with winds calming to a gentle whisper at around 5 mph, though there may still be gusts whipping through. Tomorrow brings a touch of inconsistency; while the day begins mostly sunny, a chance of rain showers looms in the late afternoon, with temperatures peaking around the mid 50s before settling back into the upper 40s as the day progresses. Such transitional weather highlights the unpredictability of winter in the Midwest and sets the stage for varied outdoor activities. Dress warmly in layers, keeping waterproof attire at the ready to adapt to unexpected showers, and consider a brisk walk along the beach before the clouds roll in. Though tomorrow is not a holiday, it\u2019s a day to embrace the changing season, with the promise of vibrant, if fleeting, winter sounds and sights.",
