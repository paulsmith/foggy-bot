    "weather_report": "As the evening unfolds in Evanston, Illinois, temperatures hover in the low 40s, accompanied by a gentle embrace of moisture in the air, creating a chill that feels slightly raw. The wind whispers off Lake Michigan, adding a brisk current to the atmosphere while light drizzle intermittently graces the shore. Tonight, expect patchy drizzle and fog to persist, intermingled with the promise of rain that could arrive overnight, with temperatures rising slightly to around the mid-40s. \n\nTomorrow\u2019s forecast anticipates areas of fog, giving way to a mostly cloudy day, with temperatures peaking near the low 50s before retreating again. The winds will be more pronounced, shifting southwest with gusts that could whip up to near 35 mph. Overall, conditions may appear a bit dreary and uninviting, with the prospect of light waves that could gently lap at the shore, though not ideal for those seeking sun-kissed beach fun. For those venturing outside, layered clothing is advised to counter the chill, with perhaps a light rain jacket if you plan to head out after dark. Given the season, this climate is on the cooler side of typical for mid-December, a reminder of the winter chill settling in as the holidays approach. It's best to enjoy cozy indoor activities this evening, perhaps curling up with a good book or enjoying a warm beverage while watching the fog roll over the lake.",
