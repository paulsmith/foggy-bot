    "weather_report": "As the dawn breaks over Evanston, the current conditions present a crisp chill, with temperatures hovering in the upper 20s and a gentle breeze brushing lightly from the east. The sky is draped in a blanket of clouds, casting a gray hue over the landscape, where the sounds of distant waves lapping at the shore mingle with the whispers of winter. Looking ahead, the day's forecast suggests an evolution of these gloomy skies, with a slight chance of snow and freezing drizzle developing mid-morning, escalating to a greater likelihood of both by afternoon. The high will barely graze the low 30s, making this day feel decidedly wintry.\n\nGiven the blustery conditions, a cozy ensemble is advised\u2014layers of warmth, accompanied by a sturdy coat and reliable footwear, will be essential should you venture out. The beach, while offering the serene beauty of Lake Michigan, will likely see choppy waters, a testament to the shifting winds. Considering today is not a holiday, it's a perfect occasion for indoor activities, perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9 or a stroll through an indoor venue to escape the encroaching drizzle and potential flurries. Embrace the winter vibes, but do so with caution, as nature prepares to weave its frosty magic across Evanston.",
