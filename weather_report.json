    "weather_report": "As the evening unfolds in Evanston, the air carries a crisp coolness, typical of early December, with temperatures in the mid 40s. Currently, the conditions are mostly cloudy, lending a somewhat muted appearance to the beach scene as onlookers peer toward the calm waters of Lake Michigan. Tonight, the skies will transition to partially cloudy, expected to dip to the upper 30s, with a gentle west-southwest breeze picking up in strength around 10 to 20 mph and gusts potentially hitting 30 mph. The atmosphere remains dry and pleasant, perfect for a nightly stroll along the lakefront, benefiting from the brisk yet refreshing air.\n\nLooking forward to Sunday, the forecast promises mostly sunny skies with temperatures peaking near 50 before gradually falling. This is typical for the season, where the chill of late autumn overlaps with the onset of winter. While the waves are mild\u2014ideal for spotting the occasional waterfowl\u2014the absence of precipitation ensures a dry environment for outdoor activities. Attire should lean towards layers: a warm sweater or light jacket paired with appropriate footwear to navigate the cooling temperatures. Given the pleasant conditions, a leisurely walk on the beach or a visit to one of the local parks would be a fitting way to enjoy this seasonally appropriate weather.",
