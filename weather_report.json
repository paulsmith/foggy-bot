    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a biting chill, with temperatures hovering in the low single digits, compounded by a robust breeze that adds to the discomfort. The sky appears mostly clear, though the air carries the promise of a chilly day ahead. As for today's forecast, expect partly sunny skies with a high nearing 11 degrees, but temperatures will decrease to around 9 in the afternoon. Wind chills may plummet to as low as -10 due to a persistent west-northwest wind, gusting fiercely, intensifying the sense of cold. \n\nTonight, conditions will remain partly cloudy as temperatures dip to around 0. The wind will continue to howl from the northwest, and wind chill values could reach a frigid -19. Opportunities for recreational activities outdoors may be limited; however, bundled-up walks near the beautiful shores of Lake Michigan might be enjoyable for those hearty enough to brave the elements. Given the season, these temperatures are quite typical for mid-February in the Midwest, reflecting the cold, crisp reality of a Chicago winter.",
