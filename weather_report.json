    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the night air is sharp and biting, with temperatures nestled in the low 30s and a steady, howling wind creating a pronounced chill. The cloudy sky shrouds visibility, casting an almost gray hue over the beach that stretches towards Lake Michigan. As we look ahead, tonight holds the potential for a few snow showers, especially before the clock strikes midnight. With the wind dialing down somewhat to a gentler breeze, residents can expect a low at around 27 degrees, accompanied by gusts that may still catch you off guard.\n\nThe forecast for Wednesday presents a similar narrative; snow may return as day breaks, although accumulation is projected to be minimal. High temperatures are expected to hover near 31 degrees, but by afternoon, a noticeable drop will leave us feeling even chillier, with temperatures retreating into the low 20s. While there's a decent chance for precipitation, the wave conditions on Lake Michigan are likely to remain manageable, perfect for those who appreciate the serenity of a winter beach scene. Dressing in warm layers is advisable; think winter coats, hats, and sturdy footwear to stay cozy against the brisk, invigorating air. Despite being firmly in the winter season, these temperatures are quite typical for December in this region. Vertical movements on the shore may be limited, but a brisk walk to relish the tranquil beauty of the lake under these cloudy skies could be quite refreshing.",
