The sky is shrouded in heavy cloud cover, with the temperature lingering at a comfortable 64 degrees, expected to climb slightly as the night progresses. A brisk south-southwest wind, gusting dramatically at times, creates a restless energy along the shoreline, hinting at tumultuous conditions in the waters nearby.\n\nThursday promises to be a day of fleeting sunshine shattered by persistent rain. The morning will see a continuation of showers and thunderstorms, likely tapering off by early afternoon, but not before bringing additional rainfall of up to half an inch. As temperatures drop to around 56 later in the day, the air will feel quite different, inviting thick layers for comfort. Given the aggressive winds\u2014a mix of gusty beginnings and later calmness\u2014dress warmly, perhaps in a waterproof jacket, while sturdy shoes may help navigate the slick pavement. With a combination of rain-soaked landscapes and riled waters, the beach is best viewed from a distance today, but finding shelter to unwind with a good book or enjoying a warm beverage at a local caf\u00e9 could provide a perfect opportunity to savor this dreary but contemplative weather.",
