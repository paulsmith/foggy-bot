    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current conditions are marked by a brisk chill, with temperatures lingering in the upper 30s. Light rain combines with a haze of mist, creating a damp and somewhat dreary atmosphere, while the gusty winds from the northeast howl at nearly 75 miles per hour, adding an edge to the already crisp coastal air. As the afternoon unfolds, expect a continuation of cloudy skies and a chance of scattered rain, alongside a gradual drop to around 35 degrees. Tonight, the temperatures will dip into the upper 20s, with breezy conditions persisting, making it feel notably colder.\n\nThe overall appearance outside is rather unpleasant, highlighted by the dreary palette of the rain-soaked landscape against the swirl of the lake's waves. Given the current forecast, wave conditions could be choppy, as gusty winds may stir up the waters of Lake Michigan. Residents and visitors would do well to layer up with warm, water-resistant attire to cope with the chill and potential precipitation. The temperatures remain consistent with winter norms for this time of year in the Midwest, as the region endures the depths of winter. With the current conditions and impending weather, outdoor activities are likely better suited for those venturing out briefly, perhaps along covered areas to take in the view of the lake, rather than prolonged exposure amidst the chilly, damp elements.",
