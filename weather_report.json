    "weather_report": "As twilight descends over Evanston, the air carries a crispness that underscores the chill of late October. Currently, the skies are partly cloudy, with the temperature dipping close to 40 degrees, accompanied by a brisk west-northwest wind that snatches at the edges of jackets and stirs up the fallen leaves. The conditions create a sense of stark beauty along the beach, as the waters of Lake Michigan reflect vague hints of moonlight, abutting the rocky shoreline. The shore appears fairly calm, a stark contrast to the gusts that sweep through\u2014at times fierce\u2014whipping up the air and casting shadows across the landscape.\n\nLooking ahead, Friday is set to unveil sunnier skies with a high in the low fifties, promising a reprieve from the evening chill that envelopes the area now. The breeze will taper off, making the day more pleasant for outdoor endeavors. Given the time of year, dressing in layers is advisable\u2014perhaps a warm sweater or light jacket for the morning, transitioning to a more relaxed fit as the day warms slightly. Additionally, this Halloween evening carries an undercurrent of festivity, though the cool air calls for quick movements rather than lingering outside. A cozy indoor gathering, perhaps with a hot beverage and seasonal treats, could be a delightful way to embrace the spirit of the night while staying warm.",
