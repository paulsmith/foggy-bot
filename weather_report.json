    "weather_report": "The current weather in Evanston, Illinois, paints a chilly picture with temperatures hovering in the mid teens. The air feels quite brisk, with a steady, fierce breeze sweeping in from the west, lending an invigorating touch to the evening. Conditions remain partly cloudy, allowing occasional glimpses of the star-strewn sky, but no precipitation is forecasted for now. \n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the promise of a brighter day unfolds, as mostly sunny skies will take center stage, with temperatures expected to climb to the low 30s. The wind is predicted to back off a touch, becoming a gentler breeze, which will make the outdoor atmosphere feel a bit more inviting for those venturing outside. Given the seasonal context, these temperatures are indeed typical for early December in this region. Attire recommendations would lean towards layering up\u2014think warm coats, hats, and gloves\u2014and perhaps a sturdy pair of boots if you're planning to brave the beach or nearby parks tomorrow. With the sunny forecast and a crisp feel in the air, it\u2019s an ideal time for a brisk walk or an adventurous outing.",
