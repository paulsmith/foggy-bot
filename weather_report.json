    "weather_report": "Today in Evanston, the winter chill is palpable, with current temperatures hovering in the low 20s, creating a crisp and cool atmosphere, especially with the wind making its presence known. The air feels fresh under mostly clear skies, but be aware of the fierce gusts reaching over 60 miles per hour, which can bite through even the heaviest of jackets as they sweep across the beach and Lake Michigan.\n\nAs the day progresses, the forecast suggests a transformation to mostly sunny conditions with a high nearing the mid-40s\u2014quite invigorating for this time of year. Tonight, temperatures will drop to around the high 20s, and the wind will diminish slightly but remain noticeable. With no precipitation expected today, the beach remains inviting despite the cold. The waves will likely be restless, stirred by the howling winds, making the water's edge a sight for those willing to brave the outdoors. Given the chilly weather, layering up in warm clothing is advisable; a heavy coat, gloves, and a hat are essential to stay comfortable. Though it\u2019s not the season for traditional outdoor leisure, a brisk walk along the shoreline might yield stunning views and a recharged spirit as winter gently grips the landscape.",
