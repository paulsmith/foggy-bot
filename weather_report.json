    "weather_report": "In Evanston today, the morning chill sets a bracing tone, with current temperatures hovering in the mid-teens and a howling breeze contributing to a biting wind chill. The sky appears mostly clear, offering a glimpse of bright sunlight that will warm the day as we progress toward a high near the low twenties. However, expect temperatures to drop to around four degrees in the evening, marking a stark transition that will feel particularly frigid. \n\nThroughout the day, the absence of precipitation promises a dry experience, although the wind remains gusty, making outdoor activities feel brisk. As wave activities stir off the shores of Lake Michigan, it could create a captivating yet tumultuous scene, ideal for brief views but not for long stays along the beach. Dress warmly in layers, with hats and gloves highly recommended to combat the cold. This time of year, temperatures are typical for a Chicago winter, embodying the seasonal chill familiar to this region. Given these conditions, a leisurely stroll or brief venture outside might be invigorating, while cozy indoor activities beckon as evening settles in.",
