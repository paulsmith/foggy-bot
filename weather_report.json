    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the weather currently presents a cool and damp atmosphere, with temperatures in the low 50s under thick, swirling clouds. The air carries a briskness, complemented by a steady, gusty wind that stirs the surroundings, making it feel a touch colder as it sweeps from the northwest. Patchy drizzle is already making its presence felt, hinting at the possibility of rain persisting throughout the day, especially before 3 PM, when a slightly higher chance of precipitation arises. As the day unfolds, expect temperatures to dip to the mid 40s, creating a rather chilly environment by afternoon.\n\nThe beach's tranquil setting may appear inviting, but the clouds and persistent drizzle give it a dreary tone, making it less than ideal for outdoor leisure. The waves on Lake Michigan could turn restless with the wind's vigor, though not overly imposing for those keen on watching from a distance. Given the dampness and wind, layered clothing is prudent; a warm jacket accompanied by a hat and perhaps an umbrella would enhance comfort today. As we remain firmly in the grip of late November, these conditions fall well within the seasonal norm for this time of year in the Midwest, where chilliness reigns. With the holiday season approaching, this evening would be suited for cozy indoor activities rather than outdoor excursions.",
