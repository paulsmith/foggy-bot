    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a cool and slightly damp atmosphere, with temperatures resting in the low 40s and notable humidity creating a crisp feel in the air. The south wind, though light, whispers a reminder of the seasonal chill as we look towards the lake, which is currently veiled under mostly cloudy skies. As night deepens, expect the clouds to persist, leading to a low around 43 overnight.\n\nLooking ahead to Saturday, the overcast skies will remain, with temperatures peaking in the low 50s before gradually dipping to around 50 in the afternoon. The wind will pick up slightly, becoming a gentle breeze from the south, which may aid in cutting through the chill, though gusts could reach up to 25 mph. Fortunately, no precipitation is anticipated, making for a dry day despite the cloud cover. The cool and damp conditions are typical for mid-November in the region, so dressing in layers is advised, perhaps with a warm jacket and a light hat for outdoor activities. With Thanksgiving approaching, many may be inclined to enjoy local parks or cafes as the holiday spirit begins to stir.",
