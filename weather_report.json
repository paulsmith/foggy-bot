    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather paints a rather dreary picture, characterized by a chilly atmosphere complemented by a gentle drizzle and enveloping fog, as temperatures hover in the mid 30s. The air is thick and damp, contributing to a rather uncomfortable feel that is typical for a late January day along Lake Michigan. As we look ahead, the forecast suggests a continuation of this weather into the overnight hours, with rain expected to persist and visibility likely to remain compromised due to fog. A low around the upper 30s is anticipated, with the east wind subtly shifting into the northeast, intensifying to a gusty breeze of up to 25 mph by Friday afternoon.\n\nFriday is poised to bring patchy fog interspersed with showers and possibly thunderstorms before morning gives way to steady rain throughout the day. Expect temperatures to drop to the low 30s later on, making outdoor excursions less than inviting. With wave conditions due to the winds, the lake might whip up some notable swells, though beachgoers would likely be deterred by the rain and chill. Given these circumstances, it's advisable to layer up, opting for waterproof attire and sturdy footwear to navigate the damp conditions. As for activities, it seems more prudent to stay cozy indoors, perhaps indulging in a good book or savoring a warm drink, as the day aligns more with hibernation than outdoor adventure.",
