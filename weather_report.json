    "weather_report": "This evening in Evanston, the coastal air feels crisp and cool under cloudy skies, with a temperature settling into the low 40s. Currently, a strong and gusty wind sweeps in from the west, creating a blustery atmosphere that combines with the chill, making it feel even colder. As we look ahead to tonight, expect mostly cloudy conditions, with temperatures dipping to the mid-30s and the wind easing slightly, though still enough to give a notable chill.\n\nFor Tuesday, the forecast offers a glimmer of brightness with partly sunny skies, although temperatures will remain on the cooler side, peaking near 40 degrees and drifting lower into the afternoon. With gusts calming down to a gentle breeze, the day will have the potential to feel more pleasant than today. Wave conditions on the lakeshore may be stirred up by the lingering winds, making it less than ideal for any laid-back beach activities. Recommend dressing in warm layers if venturing outdoors, ideally a wind-resistant jacket to combat the chill. As the region embraces the early winter season, these temperatures fall right in line with expectations\u2014typical for this time of year. Given the forecast and conditions, outdoor activities may be limited, but a brisk walk along the beach can be invigorating for those who appreciate the shoreline's winter beauty.",
