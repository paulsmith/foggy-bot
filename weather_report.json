    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Evanston, the scene is enveloped in a gentle yet persistent rain, cloaking the landscape in a damp and humid embrace. Current temperatures hover in the mid-60s, complemented by a blustery south wind that rattles the trees and sends a shiver through the air. The clouds are thick and gray, casting a shadow over the day as light rain continues to fall, promising to linger well into the night. \n\nLooking ahead, the weather will remain dominated by rain throughout the early hours, with a low settling around the low 60s. Come Monday, expect more rain in the morning with a glimmer of activity in the form of possible showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon, as the temperature peaks near 70. The waves on Lake Michigan may roar with the wind\u2019s intensity, making for an unsettled shoreline with surf that could be quite choppy. Given the conditions, bundling up in waterproof attire is essential if venturing outside, and perhaps saving indoor activities for the day is wiser. The current climate reflects a typical, albeit brisk, autumn in the Midwest as nature prepares for the cold grip of winter. Ideal activities today might include cozying up with a book, enjoying the rhythmic sound of rain, or taking part in a local caf\u00e9\u2019s warm offerings while the world gets a wash.",
