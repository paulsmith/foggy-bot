    "weather_report": "Tonight in Evanston, conditions are decidedly chilly, with temperatures hovering in the low 40s and a heavy blanket of fog enveloping the landscape, lending an almost ethereal quality as visibility diminishes. The air has a dampness to it, compounded by a brisk breeze blowing from the south. As the night progresses, expect some patchy drizzle and the likelihood of light rain, particularly in the late evening hours. Overnight, temperatures might lift slightly, reaching the mid-40s, but the southerly winds will begin to calm.\n\nLooking ahead to Monday, there\u2019s still a chance of rain and lingering fog in the early morning, which will gradually give way to cloudy skies throughout the day. Highs will approach the low 50s, with temperatures dropping as the afternoon moves on. The wind will pick up from the southwest, creating a rather blustery atmosphere. Given the moisture lingering in the air and the cool temperatures, it\u2019s wise to dress warmly, opting for layers that can be adjusted as conditions fluctuate. This damp, chilly weather is typical for December in the Midwest, a stark contrast to the sunny skies of summer. Outdoor activities may be best limited to brief forays, perhaps a quick walk to appreciate the stark beauty of the beach area, but generally, a cozy evening indoors would suit many better on this foggy December night.",
