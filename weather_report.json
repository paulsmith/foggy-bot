    "weather_report": "The current temperature in Evanston hovers in the mid-teens, wrapped in a quiet, chilly embrace with mostly cloudy skies overhead. As the afternoon unfolds, you can expect a welcoming shift towards mostly sunny conditions, with temperatures rising to the upper 20s before settling back to around 23 degrees. A brisk west wind will accompany this warming, bringing gusts that make it feel even cooler, with the evening plunging to a low in the mid-teens. The combination of temperature and wind may produce a notable wind chill, so plan to bundle up if venturing outdoors.\n\nWith no precipitation in sight, the shoreline will be serene, although the lake's surface may exhibit some gentle waves typical for this time of year. Typical late November temperatures can feel uncharacteristically harsh, yet today\u2019s weather is fairly representative of the season's chill. It\u2019s advisable to layer well, donning hats and gloves for any outdoor activities. Enjoying a brisk walk along the beach or savoring a warm drink at a nearby caf\u00e9 would be ideal given the clear afternoon skies and refreshing air. There are no major holidays today, but the festive season is on the horizon, marking a perfect time for preparation and cozy outings.",
