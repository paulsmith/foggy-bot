    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a cool and overcast afternoon, with temperatures in the low 50s and a rather blustery southeast wind stirring up the atmosphere. As we look ahead to later today, expect the clouds to break slightly, offering a glimpse of sunshine, though temperatures are unlikely to rise much higher. Tonight brings the potential for patchy drizzle and scattered showers, particularly between 7 and 8 PM, accompanied by a gentle breeze shifting to the south southeast. This could lead to a moist evening, with a chance of rain lingering as temperatures dip into the upper 40s.\n\nThe day's weather creates a somewhat dreary appearance at the beach, with choppy wave conditions reflecting the gusty winds from Lake Michigan. This isn\u2019t the best day for leisurely strolls along the shore or sunbathing, but it might suit those seeking a solitary moment by the water or a chance to embrace the fresh air. For outdoor endeavors, layering will be advisable, as a light jacket should keep you comfortable. With the season\u2019s shift toward deeper winter, these conditions are typical for late November in Illinois, where the chill often accompanies the cloudiness. As November draws to a close, it\u2019s a time that whispers of cozy gatherings indoors, while the lingering holiday spirit\u2014just weeks away from December celebrations\u2014adds a hint of warmth to the quiet landscape.",
