    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently experiencing a chilly evening with temperatures in the upper 40s and a brisk, howling breeze from the south. The air feels damp, adding to the crispness of the night, particularly as clouds blanket the sky. As we look to the forecast, there\u2019s a slight chance of rain showers developing after 11 PM, with low temperatures dropping to the mid 40s, sustaining that cool, damp feeling. Staying mostly cloudy, Sunday may only offer a modest warming up to the upper 50s, still accompanied by a possibility of rain showers throughout the day.\n\nThe beach scene, while currently gloomy, holds a certain serene charm under nightfall, although the potential for rain might hinder pleasant outdoor activities. Those wanting to venture out should certainly dress warmly with layers and consider a rain jacket to prepare for intermittent showers. Despite the chilly air, the typical autumn temperature for this time of year adds to the experience; however, the conditions may not be ideal for a walk along the shore, especially if waves pick up. If you\u2019re inclined to enjoy the outdoors, perhaps a quick visit to the beach for a brisk stroll or a dash to a nearby caf\u00e9 might be preferable as we edge closer to the end of the week.",
