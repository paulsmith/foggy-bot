    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a chilly scene with the temperature resting in the upper 20s. The air is damp and has a slightly biting quality, characteristic of a cloudy December morning. As the day progresses, residents can expect scattered rain and snow showers to move in after mid-afternoon, with the high reaching into the upper 30s before settling back into the low 30s. A brisk wind from the west-southwest will add a fierce chill, with gusts possibly reaching up to 50 mph, heightening the sense of a wintry day.\n\nAs night approaches, temperatures will dive into the mid-teens, making for a decidedly cold evening; wind chill values may feel even more frigid, dipping below zero. Precipitation chances remain modest, with light accumulations of snow possible before 10 PM. Those venturing outside should dress warmly in layers, including a sturdy coat, gloves, or mittens, and a hat, to fend off the biting cold. Given it's December in the Midwest, the current temperatures align with what one might expect for this time of year, although the upcoming conditions could dampen any outdoor holiday preparations. With blustery conditions and the likelihood of showers, it's perhaps better suited for cozy indoor activities than for a stroll by the beach or park this evening.",
