    "weather_report": "Evanston, Illinois, awakes to a chilly scene with temperatures lingering in the mid 20s, accompanied by a damp, somewhat biting breeze that gives the air a brisk feel. The sky remains mostly cloudy, obscuring the early morning sun, as gusts howl through the area at over 50 miles per hour, creating a wild atmosphere reminiscent of mid-winter. The beach, a serene yet stark vista this time of year, reflects the muted colors of dawn, where the approaching waves could hint at the stormy weather to come. Today\u2019s forecast suggests a transition, with the possibility of scattered rain and snow showers later in the afternoon. The high will peak just shy of the upper 30s, falling to around 34 as the day closes, bringing with it the stark reality of December in Illinois; winter is here to stay.\n\nGiven these conditions, it would be wise to dress warmly\u2014layers and wind-resistant outerwear are essential to ward off the chill. While wave conditions at the shore may rise with the gusty winds, it is advisable to reconsider any outdoor activities later in the day, particularly with precipitation on the horizon. This time of year typically sees such temperatures, but the persistent winds can make it feel significantly colder. As we are in the early days of December, while not a major holiday, significant celebrations are just around the corner, making this a fine time to prepare for the festivities ahead.",
