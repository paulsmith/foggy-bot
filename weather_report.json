    "weather_report": "The weather in Evanston, Illinois, this early morning is quite chilly with the temperature hovering just above 30 degrees, accompanied by a layer of clouds that soften the sky\u2019s brightness. The atmosphere holds a dampness that adds to the coolness, creating a crisp feel that may warrant a warm jacket if venturing outdoors. As the sun rises, temperatures are expected to gradually climb towards mid 30s, while a gentle breeze from the northwest will pick up, bringing with it gusts that may feel brisk at times.\n\nLooking forward to Thanksgiving Day, the weather promises to remain mostly cloudy with a high near 36 in the early afternoon, followed by a gradual drop in temperatures. Winds will shift to a slightly stronger tone, creating a blustery chill that could make outdoor plans less than ideal unless cloaked in warm attire. Fortunately, precipitation seems to be absent, and wave conditions along Lake Michigan are likely moderate, suggesting that while the beach may lack morning sun, it won't present dangerous conditions for those drawn to the waterside for a contemplative stroll. Given the season, this weather pattern is typical for late November in the Midwest, encouraging indoor gatherings and warm meals as families come together for the holiday.\n\nFor those planning outdoor activities, warm clothing is advisable\u2014a heavy coat, insulated gloves, and a hat will contribute to comfort against the cold air. As everyone prepares to celebrate this festive occasion, the ambiance created by the season invites cozy activities, making it a perfect day for enjoying meals with loved ones or engaging in leisurely indoor pursuits while the clouds drift overhead.",
