    "weather_report": "As evening descends upon Evanston, the atmosphere carries a chill with current temperatures hovering in the mid-30s accompanied by overcast skies. The brisk north-northwest wind creates a spirited chill, rendering the outdoor conditions quite cool and damp, ideal for a cozy indoor evening rather than outdoor excursions. Wave conditions along Lake Michigan are moderate, reflecting the gusty winds that stir the waters, but no significant precipitation is anticipated at this time, allowing for a relatively dry evening.\n\nLooking ahead to the forecast for Tuesday, the clouds will remain firmly in place, with temperatures peaking near the mid-30s before gradually dropping in the afternoon. This season is typical for late December in the Chicago area, embracing the cold and often gray conditions that characterize a Midwestern winter. Given the chill in the air, layered clothing is advisable for anyone venturing outside, perhaps a warm coat, gloves, and a hat for comfort. With the holiday season upon us, indoor activities or festive gatherings would be far more appealing, as the night rests on the eve of Christmas Eve.",
