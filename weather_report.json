    "weather_report": "As we find ourselves in Evanston today, the air carries a crisp coolness typical for late November, with temperatures hovering in the low 50s, accompanied by a moist chill reminiscent of the autumn season. The skies are shrouded in clouds, the ambiance punctuated by a fierce northwest wind, suggesting a potential for patchy drizzle as the afternoon unfolds. With a chance of rain that may not deliver more than a whisper of moisture, locals can expect temperatures to dip to around the mid-40s as the day progresses\u2014a reminder of the turning season.\n\nThis wintry scene, enhanced by the chilly gusts coming off Lake Michigan, lends itself to moments where warmth becomes a priority, making layered attire sensible for those venturing outside. While the beach may be beautiful in its desolate glory, the whip of the wind and the chill in the air create an environment best suited for quick walks rather than lingering strolls. As Thanksgiving approaches in just a couple of days, consider a warm drink while enjoying a brief outing\u2014ideal before retreating to the comforts of home.",
