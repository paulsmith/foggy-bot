    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston paint a crisp and cool picture with temperatures in the mid 40s, complemented by a higher blend of moisture in the air. The wind is currently gusty, adding a briskness that you\u2019ll certainly feel when stepping outside. The scene is mostly cloudy, obscuring the stars and dampening any glow from the moon, creating a tranquil yet slightly dreary atmosphere by Lake Michigan.\n\nAs we look ahead to Wednesday, expect the weather to shift as rain becomes likely before morning light, potentially transforming any outdoor plans. Daytime temperatures will hover around the high 40s and drop to the low 40s by afternoon, with a persistent breeze from the west that could reach a vigorous 20 mph. Rain showers are expected to arrive, carrying a 60% chance of precipitation, which could leave the ground slick and the air quite damp as the day progresses. The overall feel may be a bit unpleasant, especially with the potential for showers, and coupled with the cooler temps, it\u2019s advisable to prepare with layers; a warm jacket and umbrella will be essential.\n\nGiven the current season of late November in the Midwest, these temperatures are fairly typical as we transition deeper into fall. The chill encourages cozy indoor activities, so a good day for visiting a local caf\u00e9, browsing shops, or enjoying a quiet read by the window. As the holiday season approaches, this is a perfect time to start planning seasonal events, crafting, or simply enjoying the charm of Evanston in its autumnal attire.",
