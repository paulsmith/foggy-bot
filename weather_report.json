    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the morning begins under mostly clear skies with a crisp and cool temperature settling in the low 30s. A brisk wind is stirring, creating an invigorating atmosphere by the shoreline of Lake Michigan, which could feel quite refreshing. The day ahead promises to be mostly cloudy, with temperatures only inching upward to the high 30s before nestling back into the low 30s by afternoon. Gusts from the northwest are anticipated, contributing to a somewhat chillier feel. This weather is typical for mid-December in the Midwest, where winter sets in with its characteristic bite.\n\nAs for the lake, expect some moderately choppy conditions, making it less than ideal for leisurely pursuits on the water. With no precipitation on the horizon for the day, the grey clouds should provide an understated backdrop for outdoor activities. Dress warmly in layers to combat the cool air, with a sturdy jacket and perhaps a scarf to ward off the chill. The conditions encourage a brisk walk along the beach or maybe a cozy visit to a nearby caf\u00e9 for a hot beverage. While the day may not be bright, it offers the chance to embrace winter's tranquility ahead of the festive season, with the winter solstice just around the corner.",
