    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly atmosphere, with temperatures in the mid-30s and a biting wind that howls off Lake Michigan. Light snow falls intermittently, adding a wintry touch to the overall scene. The looming clouds blanket the sky, promising more precipitation as we transition into the night. Tonight, expect scattered rain and snow showers with lows dipping into the low 30s. The winds will remain brisk, gusting up to 30 mph, creating a blustery, raw feeling outdoors.\n\nLooking ahead to Thursday, a more significant shift in weather is on the horizon, as snow is anticipated before noon, followed by a mix of rain and snow throughout the day. Highs will struggle to reach the low 40s, falling further in the afternoon. The forecast predicts up to 3 inches of new snow, shaping a winter wonderland for the community, albeit at the expense of comfortable outdoor conditions. Given these elements, bundling up in warm layers\u2014coats, scarves, and gloves\u2014is essential. The temperature is quite typical for this time of year in the Midwest, where November often brings the first real taste of winter. Ideal activities might include a cozy afternoon of reading indoors or sipping hot beverages, as the beach and outdoor walks may be less inviting amidst the cold and wintry weather.",
