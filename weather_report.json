    "weather_report": "In Evanston today, conditions are marked by a brisk, cool atmosphere, with temperatures in the low 50s and a dampness that lends a slight chill to the air. The sky is mostly cloudy, casting a muted light over the landscape as the wind stirs up from the southwest with a spirited gustiness, creating a lively yet nippy environment. While the afternoon may bring a hint of rain showers after 4 pm, there\u2019s only a slight likelihood, with clear breaks possibly offering a glimpse of sunshine.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect the temperature to rise slightly to the upper 50s before settling back into the mid-40s tonight, under partly clouded skies and light evening breezes. Conditions are better suited for those looking to enjoy a brisk walk or a leisurely moment by the lake rather than indulging in beach activities, as wave conditions may be somewhat choppy with the wind. Attire should include layers, perhaps a light jacket to counter the coolness. In this late autumn setting, temperatures are on the cooler side, reflective of the seasonal transition in the region. With no major holidays on the calendar today, it is a perfect occasion to appreciate the tranquility of the lakefront before winter envelops the area.",
