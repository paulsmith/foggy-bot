    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather paints a picture of a chilly and blustery winter day. With temperatures in the mid-20s and a stiff, howling wind, the air carries a biting chill, making it feel much colder, particularly near the lakeshore. The sky is marked by a veil of clouds, hinting at the expected flurries later today. As the afternoon progresses, scattered rain and snow showers are predicted, adding to the already brisk conditions. With a high reaching the upper 30s, it will still be quite cool, particularly as winds will gust up to 50 mph, making for a notably rugged atmosphere along the beach.\n\nAs evening approaches, temperatures are expected to drop significantly, potentially reaching the low teens, accompanied by more snow showers. For anyone stepping outside, dressing warmly is essential; layered clothing, a heavy coat, and insulated accessories are a must to combat the wind chill, which could dip to dangerously low levels. Given the season, these temperature fluctuations align with typical early December weather for this region. While this may not provide ideal conditions for outdoor activities, the adventurous might enjoy a brisk walk along the shoreline, bundled up, taking in the stark beauty of a winter lakefront. Yet, for most, the comfort of a warm indoor setting will likely be the preferred sanctuary as winter fully embraces the area.",
