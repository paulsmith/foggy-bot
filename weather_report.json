    "weather_report": "The current scene in Evanston, Illinois, reveals a rather brisk and cloudy morning, with temperatures lingering in the low 50s. The air carries a touch of crispness, complemented by a fair amount of humidity which adds a damp feel to the atmosphere. Strong gusts are sweeping through, creating a blustery backdrop as they rustle along the beach and over Lake Michigan. This morning\u2019s clouds cast a dull gray hue over the shoreline, where small waves gently lap against the sandy beach.\n\nLooking ahead to the day, conditions are set to worsen as rain showers are likely to move in after noon, intensifying into showers and thunderstorms by the evening. With temperatures expected to rise slightly to the low 60s, this change brings a 100% chance of precipitation, making it a predominantly wet day with rainfall amounts possibly reaching half an inch. Given the dampness and the blustery winds, today would be best suited for indoor activities. Residents might consider curling up with a good book or exploring local coffee shops while dodging the rain. For those braving the elements, waterproof attire is highly recommended, paired with warm layers to contend with the cool and moody weather that feels distinctly autumnal for November in this region.",
