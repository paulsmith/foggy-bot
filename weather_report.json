    "weather_report": "As night settles over Evanston, the air is crisp and cool, with a temperature hovering in the mid 40s. The sky is cloaked in clouds, contributing to a somewhat muted and subdued ambiance along the shoreline. Winds are howling from the west-northwest at a vigorous pace, creating a bracing atmosphere typical of this time of year. Currently, there\u2019s no precipitation to report, allowing for a relatively dry evening, although the temperatures are set to dip to the low 30s overnight.\n\nLooking ahead to the morrow, expect a continuation of mostly cloudy skies with temperatures struggling to reach the mid 30s, taking a slight downward turn into the afternoon. Wind gusts might add a blustery chill to the day, urging residents to dress warmly. As we are well into December, these conditions are fitting for the season in the Midwest, feeling rather characteristically wintery. The lakefront could be a challenging place for casual strolls due to the wind and cooler temps, but perhaps a brisk walk during daylight hours might invigorate the spirit. With no holidays on the immediate horizon, the focus turns to the cozy comforts of home or perhaps a quiet evening by the fire.",
