    "weather_report": "As evening settles over Evanston, current conditions reveal a brisk chill enveloping the city, with temperatures hovering in the mid 30s and a mostly cloudy sky. The atmosphere carries a noticeable bite, accentuated by a fierce wind sweeping in from the west northwest at considerable speeds. Tonight\u2019s forecast points to scattered snow showers developing before dawn, with a low dipping to around 14 degrees, compounded by wind chill values plummeting to as low as -5. While the chance of precipitation is only 30%, the wild gusts may create a dramatic scene along the beach, with waves likely rising in response.\n\nTomorrow promises little improvement, with mostly sunny skies but persistent cold, as temperatures struggle to reach the high 20s. Wind chill will continue to render it feel even colder, dipping into the negative range at times. Given these conditions, it\u2019s advisable to don heavy winter attire\u2014think thick coats, hats, scarves, and gloves\u2014to shield against the biting cold. The current temperature reflects typical December weather for this region, anchoring us firmly in the heart of winter. While outdoor activities may be limited, bundled walks along Lake Michigan could provide a bracing experience, allowing you to witness the raw beauty of nature in these chilly days leading up to the holiday season.",
