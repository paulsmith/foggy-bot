    "weather_report": "In Evanston, current conditions are dominated by a biting chill, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s and a persistent, almost eerie fog complemented by light snow. The air feels heavy and damp, making the cold cut deeper as gusts howl from the west, creating an unsettling atmosphere along the lakeshore. Visibility is significantly reduced, and the usual serene beauty of Lake Michigan is obscured by the wintry conditions. \n\nAs the day progresses, expect the snow to transition into drizzle, with temperatures rising slightly to the low 40s by this afternoon. A stout northwest wind will continue to buff at 25 to 30 mph, with momentary gusts brushing 50 mph. Not much snow accumulation is anticipated as the precipitation shifts form, but be prepared for a damp, gloomy evening with a chance of lingering drizzle. Given the season, this weather aligns with the typical chill of late November in the Midwest, making warm layers and waterproof attire the sensible choice for any outdoor ventures. Activities such as a brisk walk along the beach may be invigorating but consider the gusty conditions and unsettled precipitation. As we approach the Thanksgiving holiday this week, many may find the cozy warmth indoors more appealing than venturing into the chilly outdoors.",
