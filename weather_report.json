    "weather_report": "The current conditions in Evanston paint a scene of a crisp winter night, with temperatures hovering in the mid-20s, providing a chilly feel that is intensified by a brisk wind sweeping across the beach from the west. The atmosphere is mostly clear, which offers a serene view toward Lake Michigan under the night sky, though the gusty winds contribute to a biting chill. \n\nLooking ahead, the weather forecast predicts a slightly warmer overnight low settling around 20 degrees, with a gradual rise to about 22 degrees. Friday brings a slight chance of snow showers in the morning, transitioning to mostly sunny skies as the day progresses, with a high near 24. Expect a persistent northwest breeze throughout, emphasizing the slightly uncomfortable chill typical for January in this region. Given the cold temperatures and potential for flurries, layered clothing is recommended, including warm coats, hats, and gloves. Coastal conditions may yield some wave activity, but overall outdoor activities should favor brisk walks along the shore, appreciating the beauty of the lake on a winter's day.",
