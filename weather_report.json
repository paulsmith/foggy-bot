    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a stark winter scene, with a biting chill enveloping the area. Temperatures hover in the mid 20s, accompanied by a brisk and fierce wind from the west, which only heightens the cold. The view towards Lake Michigan suggests a somber atmosphere, with mostly cloudy skies lingering. While tonight\u2019s forecast promises only light snow accumulations, the biting air coupled with gusty winds creates a distinctly unpleasant feel for those venturing outside.\n\nAs the day unfolds on Friday, expect it to start with potential flurries before the sun breaks through, bringing a welcome brightness despite the temperatures struggling to reach the mid 20s. With a steady wind propelling from the northwest, it will be important to layer up against the cold. Given the season, these conditions are quite typical for early January in the Midwest. Wave conditions on Lake Michigan may be moderate, reflecting the choppy waters stirred by the wind. For those brave enough to engage in outdoor activities, a stroll along the beach or a brisk walk in a nearby park would be invigorating, but ensure to wear warm clothing, including hats and gloves, to ward off the biting cold.",
