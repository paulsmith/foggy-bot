    "weather_report": "As evening settles over Evanston, temperatures hover in the chilly upper 20s, with a persistent, gusty wind sweeping across the beach, making the air feel brisk and sharp. The sky is blanketed in clouds, adding a grayish hue to the landscape and hinting at the intermittent snow showers expected tonight. While the potential for significant precipitation is low, the weather adds a distinct winter feel to the atmosphere, with projections for light snow as temperatures dip to the low 20s overnight. \n\nLooking ahead to Friday, expect the morning to bring more snow flurries, tapering off by late morning, followed by a mostly sunny afternoon as temperatures struggle to reach the mid 20s. Given the wintry conditions, dressing warmly in layers, including a heavy coat, scarf, and sturdy footwear is advisable for anyone venturing outside. The temperature is right in line with typical late November weather for this region, creating an opportunity to enjoy crisp walks along the beach, albeit with the muted beauty provided by winter's approach. In this chilly backdrop, the waters of Lake Michigan may churn with moderate waves, setting a dramatic scene for those brave enough to enjoy the outdoors.",
