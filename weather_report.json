    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the milky darkness unfolds under a blanket of patchy fog, with temperatures hovering in the low 50s, inviting a sense of chill that lingers in the air. With the wind barely whispering at a standstill, the combined effect of coolness and moisture creates a damp, raw feel typical for this time of year, as a softer atmosphere settles over the beach. As the night transitions to day, expect the fog to persist until morning, giving way to a likely burst of rain showers that will march through in the late morning hours. \n\nLooking ahead, the day promises mostly cloudy skies with a high reaching into the mid-50s, allowing for a slightly somber yet tranquil ambiance along the shore of Lake Michigan. Precipitation is anticipated, with a 90% chance of rain expected, making it wise to grab a water-resistant jacket and perhaps some boots, especially if venturing outdoors. Given the season and this week of November, temperatures reflect the typical briskness of late autumn. While many outdoor activities may be curbed by the impending drizzle, visiting a nearby caf\u00e9 or continuing a good book by the window could provide warmth and comfort in contrast to the dreary weather outside.",
