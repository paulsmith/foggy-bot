    "weather_report": "This morning in Evanston, the scene is decidedly brisk, with a recent temperature hovering in the low 40s, accompanied by a notable humidity that makes the air feel somewhat chillier. The wind is howling from the southeast at a vigorous pace, adding a sharp edge to the overall atmosphere, particularly along the shoreline where the waves are visibly stirred. Cloud cover cloaks the sky, setting a grayish tone for the day ahead.\n\nAs we look to the forecast, rain is on the horizon, particularly after 5 PM, with a high expected to reach the mid-50s. Tonight promises an even higher chance of rain, with the temperature dipping to the upper 40s. Expect steady winds, creating a crisp but potentially uncomfortable evening for any outdoor endeavors. For those braving the outdoors today, a waterproof jacket would be wise, along with layers to stave off the chill from both the wind and the impending rain. Given that we're in mid-November, these temperatures are quite typical for the region, signaling that winter is just around the corner. For today, perhaps seeking shelter in a cozy cafe or engaging in indoor activities would be ideal, as the beach, while breathtaking, may not be the most inviting spot for recreation in this weather.",
