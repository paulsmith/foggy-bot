    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the night is marked by cloud cover and temperatures hovering in the mid-30s, creating a chill that's intensified by a brisk and blustery northwest wind. The air feels quite damp, bringing a bite to the skin that makes the evening just a touch uncomfortable, especially for those outdoors. As the weather shifts overnight, expect a transition to light snow with a 90% chance of precipitation, and temperatures dipping to around the freezing mark.\n\nAs Wednesday dawns, there might be remnants of this early snowfall, but the day is predicted to turn partly sunny with temperatures falling to the low 30s. The northwest winds will lighten slightly but could still gust up to 20 mph, adding to that wintry feel. Overall, the setting along the Lake Michigan shoreline this time of year can be rather bleak, with wave conditions likely remaining gentle, suitable for those contemplative strolls rather than vigorous beach activities. Given the chill in the air, it\u2019s recommended to dress warmly in layers, perhaps with a snug hat and scarf. While many may prefer to stay indoors on a day like this, it could be a fine time for winter reading by a fire or catching up on films with family as the holidays loom closer.",
