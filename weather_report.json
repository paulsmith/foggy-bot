    "weather_report": "This evening in Evanston, the temperature lingers in the low 60s, accompanied by a heavy humidity that creates a damp, almost oppressive feeling in the air. The howling winds from the west-southwest whip at 45 miles per hour, mixing with the patchy clouds overhead, which render the night mostly cloudy but not entirely dark. The forecast suggests a shift overnight as temperatures drop towards the low 50s, rising slightly to around 53 as the night progresses. Gusty winds will persist, making it feel cooler than it is, and a few sprinkles may accompany the change, with only minimal precipitation expected.\n\nThough November here tends to lean towards brisk and chilly, today's conditions verge on unusual; such warm weather at this time of year is rare. As for attire, layering will be key\u2014think light jackets over sweaters to fend off the cool breeze. With these conditions, outdoor activities may be limited. However, those braving the elements might find tranquility by the Lake Michigan shore, though the waves could be restless with the wind. Overall, this evening is best reserved for cozy indoor pursuits, perhaps with a warm drink in hand as we settle into a classic Midwest fall night.",
