    "weather_report": "In Evanston this morning, the atmosphere is characterized by a damp and breezy chill, with temperatures lounging in the low 50s. The air carries a heavy humidity, making it feel a bit more raw as clouds dominate the skyline. Gusty winds from the northwest add a sharp edge to outdoor activities. As we glide into the afternoon, expect isolated rain showers to sweep in post-4 PM, with skies remaining mostly overcast. Tonight, a brief reprieve from the rain is anticipated, but the cloud cover will keep temperatures edging down toward the mid 40s. \n\nWave conditions along Lake Michigan are likely to be modest, perhaps inviting a stroll along the shoreline, but boaters should remain cautious due to the wind. Given the environmental cues, a cozy jacket is advisable, accompanied by waterproof footwear and perhaps an umbrella handy for the evening's light showers. This November day falls within typical seasonal temperatures for the region, reflecting the onset of late autumn, where cooler, unpredictable weather holds sway. While outdoor activities may be limited by the looming rain, a visit to a local caf\u00e9 or library could provide a delightful escape amid the chill.",
