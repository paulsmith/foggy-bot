    "weather_report": "As dusk settles over Evanston, expect cool and slightly biting conditions, with the temperature hovering in the mid-20s. The ongoing cloudy skies obscure any hint of sun, while a brisk wind whips from the east at a lively pace, creating a raw ambiance that feels particularly wintry. Tonight, anticipate a low settling around the mid-20s, with temperatures gradually rising overnight, still accompanied by a gusty breeze that will echo the chill outside.\n\nAs for wave conditions along Lake Michigan, the water is likely calm given the lack of significant precipitation, though the winds can stir up the surface occasionally. Despite the less-than-ideal chill, those prepared in warm jackets or layers can brave an evening stroll or find comfort in cozy local caf\u00e9s. This time of year typically ushers in the cold, and though current temperatures align with the season, one might find the conditions a bit harsher than what the festive season normally brings. With no holidays on the immediate horizon, the evening beckons for quiet reflection or preparation for the upcoming celebrations that December will bring.",
