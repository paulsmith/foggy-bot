    "weather_report": "This evening, Evanston experiences a chilly atmosphere as temperatures hover in the low 50s combined with a high humidity that adds a damp feel to the air. The conditions are overcast and quite blustery, with winds pushing through from the northwest, creating a notable chill, especially along the lakefront. As the night progresses, patchy drizzle is expected, particularly before 11 PM, making the shoreline considerably more humid and uninviting for outdoor activities.\n\nLooking towards tomorrow, cloudy skies will persist with daytime temperatures climbing slightly to the low 50s. A gentle north northwest wind will help to maintain a cooler edge, and while the higher waves along Lake Michigan may not pose a safety issue, they will deter casual beachgoers looking to enjoy the shore. This late autumn weather feels typical for mid-November in this corner of Illinois, where brisk winds and occasional drizzle set the scene. Given the forecast, it's advisable to don layers along with a waterproof jacket to stay comfortable while braving the elements. Enjoying indoor activities like visiting local cafes or exploring cultural spots may be the best choice for this damp day.",
