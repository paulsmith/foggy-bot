    "weather_report": "As of the early hours in Evanston, temperatures are hovering in the low 30s, accompanied by a brisk, howling wind that cuts through the air. The atmosphere feels quite raw and chilly, typical for this time of year, with cloud cover casting a gray veil over the landscape. Current conditions suggest a stark winter chill, and with this level of wind, it can feel even colder than the thermometer indicates. The lakefront is quiet, likely obscured by the murky night, but the potential for snow showers looms on the horizon, as a 60% chance for flurries emerges with the dawn. \n\nExpect mainly cloudy skies throughout Wednesday, with temperatures peaking near the low 30s before dipping significantly in the afternoon. Winds will remain gusty, escalating from the west northwest, which may lead to fairly choppy conditions on the lake. If venturing outside today, layering up is advisable\u2014think warm coats, hats, and scarves, as the wind chill will be a notable factor. While the day might feel uninviting for long outdoor activities, brief jaunts along the shore or to enjoy the sight of snowflakes may offer a gentle touch of winter\u2019s charm during this otherwise quiet December day.",
