    "weather_report": "This morning in Evanston, the temperature stands at a brisk mid-teens, under mostly clear skies with a chilly breeze sweeping in from the southwest. The scenery along Lake Michigan shows gentle waves lapping at the shore, reflecting the crispness of the air. As we look ahead, the day promises mostly sunny skies, with temperatures climbing toward the high 20s but falling back to around 24 by evening. Wind gusts will be noticeable, adding a blustery edge to the afternoon, making it feel even chillier.\n\nThe overall appearance outside is pleasant yet requires some consideration; bundled attire is advisable given the current season and the wind's bite. While precipitation isn't forecasted today, the waves might be slightly choppy but generally manageable. With the vibrant sunlight, it's perfect for a brisk walk along the beach or enjoying a hot drink at a nearby caf\u00e9. As holiday preparations get underway, today is a wonderful opportunity to embrace the winter beauty of Evanston.",
