    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the temperature rests in the low 30s, creating a brisk atmosphere under a cloudy sky. A fierce wind from the west-northwest adds a biting chill, making it feel noticeably colder. Overnight, expect the weather to remain mostly cloudy with temperatures dropping to the upper 20s. Wednesday holds a promising chance for snow showers as the day progresses, with highs peaking near 31 before falling into the low 20s by afternoon. Windy conditions will persist, with gusts possibly reaching 40 mph, resulting in an unsettled feel throughout the day.\n\nAs for the shoreline, wave conditions will likely be rough due to the blustery winds, making it less than ideal for outdoor pursuits typically enjoyed along Lake Michigan. The wintry chill suggests that layered clothing is essential; a warm coat, gloves, and a hat are encouraged to counteract the cold and wind. With the winter season fully underway, these temperatures are consistent with what one would expect for December in this region. While outdoor activity may be limited, those interested in wintertime fun could consider visiting local cafes or participating in indoor holiday events, with the festive season just around the corner.",
