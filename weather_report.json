    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston are marked by a brisk chill, with temperatures hovering in the low 20s and a noticeable wind creating a sharp bite in the air. It's mostly clear, making for a refreshing atmosphere despite the ongoing frostiness. The wind, fierce and relentless, whips across the landscape at nearly 50 miles per hour, contributing to a distinct winter feel that wraps around the beach and Lake Michigan's shoreline.\n\nAs we anticipate tonight, expect the clouds to gather slightly, bringing a partly cloudy sky with temperatures dipping to around 19 degrees. Tomorrow offers a glimmer of sunshine; however, temperatures are expected to peak near 26 before waning through the afternoon. The winds will shift to a gentler breeze, making the day manageable though still cold. Given the frosty conditions and the strong waves on the lake, outdoor activities should be approached with caution. Those venturing out should don layers for warmth\u2014heavy coats, hats, and gloves to fend off the chill will be necessary. In this winter season, these temperatures align closely with what one would expect, as we embrace the deepening of winter's grip. While it might not be the optimal day for extended outdoor adventures, a brisk walk along the beach could provide a moment of solitude amidst the vibrant, raw beauty of the winter landscape.",
