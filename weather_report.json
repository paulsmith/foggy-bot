    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the current weather presents a chilly scene with a temperature hovering in the mid-30s, accompanied by a cloud-covered sky that lends a somber quality to the day. The atmosphere feels crisp, yet the impending rain adds a layer of dampness that could make stepping outside feel less inviting. As we look toward the afternoon, a steady drizzle is expected, likely picking up after 3 PM, when temperatures are projected to rise towards the high 30s. This evening will see a continuation of rain, thickening into a potentially foggy night as temps rise again, creating a stickiness in the air as gusty southeastern winds whip through at speeds reminiscent of a brisk walk.\n\nThe beaches may showcase interesting wave conditions with surf creating moderate swells, though it\u2019s not likely to be a day for swimming or sunbathing. As far as attire is concerned, a warm rain jacket and waterproof boots would be prudent choices for those venturing out, given the 100% chance of precipitation forecasted and the ever-shifting Lake Michigan breezes. This December day aligns with typical expectations for the season in this region, but the wet chill may drive many towards indoor activities. For those willing to brave the elements, a leisurely stroll along the shore could be refreshing, but plan for warmer drinks and cozy gatherings indoors if you prefer to stay dry.",
