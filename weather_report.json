    "weather_report": "As night descends on Evanston, conditions remain quite brisk with a temperature hovering in the low 30s, while a persistent cloud cover casts a gloomy pall over the beach. The air feels sharply cool, reminiscent of damp winter days, as a fierce wind whips from the south at speeds that could chill even the most bundled-up passerby. This evening, there's a chance of freezing drizzle after the early hours, adding to the already overcast landscape. \n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, a chance of drizzle looms before noon, transitioning into rain later in the day, with highs barely climbing into the upper 30s. Winds will continue to gust, making it feel a bit chillier than the actual temperature suggests. Given these blustery conditions and imminent precipitation, residents are advised to dress warmly in layers, perhaps donning a waterproof outer layer to combat the likelihood of drizzle. As we are well into late December, these temperatures are fairly typical for the season, fitting into that wintry mix that characterizes this time of year in the Midwest. Given the forecast and the chilly aesthetic outside, it may be a day better suited for cozy indoor activities rather than braving the elements.",
