    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently enveloped in a chilly embrace as temperatures hover in the mid-20s, making for a crisp and cool night. The air feels rather blustery, with strong winds whipping in from the east, stirring the waters of Lake Michigan into a frothy commotion. Conditions are mostly cloudy, imparting a muted glow to the skyline, and this visual haze is likely to linger as the evening progresses. \n\nLooking ahead to Saturday, expect more than just a cold breeze; rain is on the horizon, likely to move in by the afternoon. The high will barely scrape the upper 30s, accompanied by a continued fierce wind that may kick up to 30 mph. As we transition from this invigorating night into a potentially soggy day, the prospect of precipitation should encourage a shift in attire\u2014best to layer up and keep a raincoat handy, as well as sturdy footwear for possibly slushy conditions. For those eying outdoor activities, be cautious: the elements may not cooperate with extensive plans, but an invigorating walk along the shoreline could still bring a refreshing vitality to the day ahead. With no major holidays on the immediate horizon, this Saturday marks a straightforward winter day\u2014a reminder of the season\u2019s chill and a chance to embrace the cozy warmth of the indoors.",
