    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois, present a chilly scene with a temperature in the mid 30s, under a blanket of clouds. The air feels damp and the brisk winds stir up a blustery chill, making it a day when feeling a bit nippy is the norm as you look out towards the waves of Lake Michigan. While the surf appears restless, with waves crashing against the shore, the beach won't see much activity as drizzles and fog are expected, especially later in the evening.\n\nTonight, fog will settle in with a slight chance of rain, making the evening feel particularly damp. As temperatures creep up slightly to the high 30s, venturing out will require a cozy layer\u2014think warm jackets and perhaps a scarf to fend off the cool breeze. Given the weather, coupled with the holiday season around Christmas, it's a good night to stay indoors or cozy up over warm drinks, rather than enjoy outdoor festivities. The atmosphere may be subdued, but the festive spirit can still warm hearts despite the chilly, gray backdrop.",
