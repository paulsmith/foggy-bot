    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois, are characterized by cool temperatures lingering in the upper 30s, coupled with a heavy blanket of fog and mist that veils the landscape in a muted gray. The air feels damp and chilly, making for a rather uninviting outdoor experience. As we look towards the forecast, we can expect drizzle and fog to persist overnight, with temperatures gradually lifting to the upper 30s, and a gentle breeze sweeping from the southeast. Tomorrow holds similar prospects, featuring patchy drizzle and fog that may linger until mid-morning, with afternoon highs reaching the mid-40s.\n\nWave conditions along Lake Michigan might not be ideal for recreational activities, as choppy waters accompany the dreary weather. Precipitation chances are modest, so while you may want to carry an umbrella, prolonged rain is not anticipated. For those venturing outside, layers are a must; consider donning a warm, water-resistant jacket and sturdy footwear to combat the cool air and occasional drizzle. The temperature is quite typical for the season in this region, maintaining that distinct winter chill. With the day being a post-holiday, it may not beckon for outdoor activities, but a cozy stroll along the lakefront could provide a serene backdrop to unwind after festive celebrations.",
