    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston paint a wintry picture, with temperatures hovering in the mid 20s and a blustery wind whipping from the east. The air feels rather brisk, lending an almost biting chill to the day as clouds blanket the sky, creating a muted ambiance. As we look ahead, this afternoon promises similar cloudiness, with highs approaching the low 30s. However, the real story lies in the forecast for tonight, which anticipates freezing drizzle before dawn, raising the potential for slick conditions. There\u2019s an 80% chance of precipitation, but little to no ice accumulation is expected.\n\nGiven the current season, these temperatures are typical for early February in the Midwest, and the wave conditions on Lake Michigan are likely choppy, matching the howling gusts forecasted. If you venture outside, a warm jacket, hat, and gloves are essential attire, particularly with the wind chill making it feel colder. While outdoor activities might be limited to brisk walks, be cautious of potential ice as the day progresses. As it\u2019s not a holiday today, but with more wintery weather ahead, it may be a good time to prepare for upcoming warmer months.",
