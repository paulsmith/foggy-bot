    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston are marked by a brisk chill, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s and the air feeling quite damp. As light snow falls, visibility appears muted, and the blustery winds whip down from the northwest, creating a sharp bite when stepping outside. Throughout the night, expect scattered snow showers to persist, with temperatures inching slightly upward, staying around the low 30s. The gusty winds could reach up to 30 mph, adding to the overall wintry atmosphere.\n\nLooking ahead to Thursday, a more substantial winter weather event is anticipated, with snow transitioning to a mix of rain and snow before noon. A high near the low 40s will offer little respite from the bluster, with winds gusting as high as 50 mph, making outdoor activities feel rather unwelcome. Expected snow accumulation of 2 to 4 inches will blanket the area, laying down a fresh layer of winter's touch. Given these conditions, layered clothing is recommended \u2013 a warm coat, hat, and sturdy boots will keep you comfortable in these chilly and wet conditions, typical for this time of year in the Midwest. While outdoor activities may be curtailed, this wintry weather provides a perfect excuse to curl up indoors with a good book or hot beverage as the season's first significant snowfall begins to settle in.",
