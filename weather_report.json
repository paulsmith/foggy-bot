    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a chilly evening with temperatures in the mid 30s, complemented by a robust breeze that adds a bit of bite to the air. The atmosphere is thick with cloud cover, creating a gray canvas overhead as visibility begins to dip with the onset of patchy fog. Tonight, the fog will become more pronounced after 11 PM, but it remains dry, allowing for a calm yet cool night under the blanket of clouds. \n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, early fog will give way to partly sunny skies, offering a glimpse of warmth with a high in the low 50s, though temperatures will gradually decline through the afternoon. The breeze will be light to moderate, fostering a pleasant and crisp atmosphere as the day unfolds. With calm waters typical of this season, those who venture out to the lake may find it inviting for a brisk walk along the shore, but it's wise to bundle up against the chill, especially in the morning. As we approach the end of November, these temperatures align closely with what we expect for this time of year, capturing the essence of late autumn in Illinois.",
