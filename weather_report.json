    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current scene is marked by a chill in the air, with temperatures hovering in the mid to high 30s, accompanied by a thick, blanket of cloud cover. The breeze is brisk, rustling the nearby trees, lending a refreshing edge to the evening that feels both cool and damp. As we look ahead, the night promises to hold onto the chill with temperatures dipping slightly close to the freezing mark, while patchy fog may develop, creating a moody atmosphere as the city settles down for the night.\n\nTomorrow brings a gradual shift, with early fog giving way to glimpses of sunshine by mid-morning. Daytime temperatures are expected to rise into the low 50s, a bit of relief from the coolness that has enveloped us. The gentle south wind might stir up some pleasant outdoor feelings, though the overall day will carry a crispness typical of late November. As for conditions on the lake, the waves will likely be modest, perfect for a quiet stroll along the beach or a brisk jog to embrace the day. Attire best suited for tomorrow would lean towards layers, including a warm jacket, as temperatures will fluctuate throughout the day. Given the time of year, these weather patterns are fairly typical for this region, making the environment one ripe for enjoying some outdoor activities, perhaps a winter walk or a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 to savor the atmosphere of the approaching holiday season.",
