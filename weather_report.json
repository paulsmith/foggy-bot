    "weather_report": "As evening settles over Evanston, the current conditions reflect a biting chill, with temperatures hovering in the low single digits. The air feels brisk, accentuated by a fierce northwesterly wind that whips through the area, creating wind chill values that can dip to a frosty -17. The sky is mostly cloudy, but tonight is expected to trend partly cloudy, giving a glimpse of the stars beneath the cold blanket of clouds. \n\nFor tomorrow, residents can anticipate a mostly sunny day, though the temperature will remain low, reaching only around the mid-teens during the afternoon. With wind chill effects still prevalent, it is advisable to bundle up before stepping outside. Presently, the lake, agitated by the gusty winds, may produce rough wave conditions, making it less than ideal for any waterfront activities. Given the brisk and biting weather, layered clothing, warm hats, and gloves are essential for anyone venturing outdoors. While February is typically marked by frigid temperatures in the Midwest, today's chill is particularly pronounced, encouraging cozy indoor pursuits rather than frolicking in the cold. Although there are no holidays on the immediate horizon, the season\u2019s winter beauty is sure to bring moments of splendor for those who appreciate the stark allure of a cold lakeside.",
