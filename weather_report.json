    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston are quite brisk, with temperatures hovering in the mid-single digits and a formidable wind adding to the chill, creating a biting atmosphere. The view of the beach would likely reflect a clear, albeit stark landscape\u2014cold air mingling with the bluish hues of Lake Michigan. As the night descends, expect a partly cloudy sky with temperatures dipping into the low single digits, while wind chills could plummet to dangerously low levels, near -13. \n\nLooking ahead to Washington's Birthday, the forecast holds promise for partly sunny skies, though it will remain cold with highs only nearing the low teens. The wind will persist, gusting occasionally, enhancing the season's crisp feel. Wave conditions will likely be choppy due to the gusty winds, making it unsuitable for water activities. For those venturing outdoors, layered attire is highly recommended, including insulated clothing, hats, and gloves to fend off the penetrating cold. This winter chill is typical for this time of year in northern Illinois, a period when residents should be well-prepared for the stark, cold beauty of the season and the potential for outdoor activities like brisk walks, provided they stay bundled up.",
