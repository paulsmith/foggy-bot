    "weather_report": "As evening falls over Evanston, the current weather paints a picture of coolness and humidity, with temperatures settled in the low 60s under a blanket of thick clouds. The air is damp, and a powerful, gusty wind whistles from the south, creating a brisk and somewhat chilly environment. With rain on the horizon, the forecast predicts a likely deluge tonight, starting just after midnight and continuing into the early hours, bringing with it a slight chance of thunderstorms. New rainfall amounts could reach half an inch, so expect a thoroughly wet and gloomy atmosphere.\n\nLooking ahead to Monday, the rain will persist, with an overall high near the upper 60s but temperatures gradually falling as the day progresses. The already humid conditions will feel heavier with the continued precipitation, making the air feel muggy and oppressive at times. As we navigate through this autumn season, these cooler temperatures are within the expected range, though the high winds and rain may make it feel somewhat more severe. For those braving the outdoors, waterproof jackets, umbrellas, and sturdy footwear are advisable. The evening\u2019s heavy clouds and rain may not be ideal for typical outdoor activities; however, it might be a perfect time for indoor pursuits\u2014curling up with a good book or enjoying a cozy movie scene might be the perfect antidote to the wet weather.",
