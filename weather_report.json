    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a crisp and cool atmosphere, with temperatures settling in the mid-20s and a blustery north-northwest wind. The air carries a certain chill, heightened by the fierce wind gusts reaching into the 50s, making outdoor activities require thoughtful preparation. As the night unfolds, we can expect partly cloudy skies, with temperatures dipping slightly but generally remaining around the low 30s overnight. \n\nLooking ahead to Thanksgiving Day, the forecast offers the promise of partly sunny skies, a welcome sight for those gathering to give thanks, albeit with temperatures only climbing into the mid-30s and then beginning to slip down again by afternoon. Wave conditions along Lake Michigan are likely to be moderate, influenced by the wind\u2019s strength; caution is advised for any water activities. As precipitation is not on the horizon, this Thanksgiving looks to be dry, providing a pleasant backdrop for family gatherings and outdoor strolls. Given the season, these temperatures are typical for late November in the Midwest. Dressing in layers, perhaps a warm jacket along with a scarf and gloves, will ensure comfort for any planned activities, whether they involve warm meals indoors or a brisk walk along the beach as daylight begins to fade.",
