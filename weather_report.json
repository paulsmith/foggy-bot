    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reflect a chilly and slightly blustery late afternoon, with temperatures hovering in the mid to high 30s under a cloudy sky. Wind gusts are robust, sweeping in from the west-southwest, contributing to a brisk feel as daylight fades. The forecast for later today boasts a shift to partly sunny skies, yet temperatures are expected to trend downward. Tonight, there's a modest chance of snow in the early hours, but little to no accumulation is anticipated, keeping the evening fairly quiet.\n\nDespite the chill, the beach scene might hold a certain stark beauty, with gentle waves reflecting the muted light of the encroaching evening. Attire should favor warmth, suggesting layers including a good coat, perhaps a hat and gloves, to comfortably enjoy any outdoor pursuits. Given the season and location, such temperatures are fairly standard for late November, veering towards the wintry side of comfort. Outdoor activities are best kept light, perhaps a brisk walk along the shore to relish the fresh air before settling in for the night.",
