    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a chilly, overcast night with temperatures in the low 20s. The air feels crisp, with a touch of bite from the cool winds, making it a fitting evening for a warm drink indoors. As we look ahead, scattered snow showers may grace the area before 11 PM, transitioning the night into a partly cloudy scene with an expected low temperature around 5 degrees. Wind chills could make it feel as low as -13, accompanied by a blustery west northwest wind, which will grow stronger throughout the night.\n\nTomorrow promises a mostly sunny day, but temperatures will barely climb into the mid-teens, accompanied by wind chills that could dip down to -14. This weather is representative of a typical December in the Midwest, where frigid conditions are the norm, and people are advised to bundle up in heavy winter attire. With the cold and potential for flurries, it would be wise to choose activities that keep you warm, such as enjoying a cozy evening indoors or perhaps taking a brisk, bundled walk along the shoreline, though the beach may be less appealing in such nippy weather.",
