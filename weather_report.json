    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois, reveal a chilly atmosphere with temperatures hovering in the mid-20s, creating a crisp and cool feel in the air. The sky is cloaked in heavy clouds, and a brisk wind from the west-northwest adds to the briskness, blowing fiercely and making for an invigorating but chilly experience by Lake Michigan. Tonight, expect intermittent snow showers with a low dipping into the low 20s, alongside a noticeable shift with temperatures gradually rising as the night progresses. The wind will remain strong, gusting up to 30 mph, maintaining that sharp edge to the evening chill.\n\nAs for upcoming weather, Friday greets us with lingering chances for snow in the morning before settling into mostly cloudy skies and a high again around the mid-20s. This period is typical for late November in the Midwest, where frigid temperatures signal the full embrace of winter. The lakeshore is likely to have some rough wave conditions, possibly choppy, making it less than ideal for leisurely walks along the beach. With winter firmly settling in, it would be prudent to layer up in warm clothing\u2014think a thick coat, gloves, and hats\u2014as you venture outside. While the day might not set the stage for outdoor festivities, a cozy afternoon indoors with a warm drink could serve as a perfect antidote to the wintery weather.",
