    "weather_report": "The current weather in Evanston finds us in a cool embrace, with temperatures lingering in the mid 30s and a gentle wind whispering in from the south. The clouds hang heavy, adding to the overcast ambiance of the night, but with only a slight chance of snow before dawn. As we look ahead to tomorrow, expect more of the same with mostly cloudy skies and high temperatures reaching into the upper 40s, dipping into the low 40s by afternoon as a light breeze continues to caress the shore.\n\nThe appearance outside is quite dreary; the beach remains calm and quiet under the cloud cover, with no significant precipitation anticipated. Wave conditions are likely to be gentle given the lull of the winds, making for a tranquil Lake Michigan experience. Dress warmly if you venture out, favoring layers suitable for the coolness\u2014perhaps a heavy coat and sturdy boots are in order. This time of year, as we embrace late November, feels typical for the season, capturing that crisp and chilly essence synonymous with a Midwestern autumn. There are certainly opportunities for cozy indoor activities like visiting a local caf\u00e9 or enjoying a film, perfect for a weekday evening when the holidays are just around the corner.",
