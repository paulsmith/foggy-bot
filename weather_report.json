    "weather_report": "In Evanston, current conditions paint a rather cooler picture with temperatures settling in the low 50s and a brisk breeze whispering from the south. The air feels a touch damp, characteristic of an overnight scene where clouds cling heavily overhead. As dawn breaks, the forecast suggests a night of scattered rain showers will transition into a morning of drizzle and overcast skies, with high temperatures barely nudging into the low 50s before retreating to the upper 40s in the afternoon. It\u2019s a day best described as dreary, amplifying the chill in the air brought on by the gusty winds, which may sweep in with a bit more vigor as the day unfolds.\n\nAs for wave conditions along Lake Michigan, expect a moderate chop reflected in the stirring waters, an indication that the windy conditions will create some fluctuation. With a 40% chance of continued light spray from scattered showers throughout the day, it\u2019s prudent to don waterproof attire if venturing outdoors. The season is consistent with this area's typical late November climate, teetering on the edge of winter. Though it's not holiday season yet, the cool, misty ambiance definitely invites a cozy retreat indoors, making it more suitable for quiet leisure activities rather than outdoor adventures. Curling up with a book or enjoying a warm beverage seems like an excellent way to embrace this chilly day.",
