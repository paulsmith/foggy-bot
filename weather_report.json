    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the day begins under a blanket of mostly cloudy skies, with temperatures hovering in the upper 40s\u2014a notably crisp start for early November. Humidity lends a dampness to the air, making the chill feel a touch sharper, while a brisk, gusty southeast wind adds an invigorating bite, stirring up the waters of Lake Michigan into a lively chatter. As the day unfolds, expect the clouds to dominate, with the temperature climbing to a high near 57. Rain showers are predicted to make their appearance later this evening after 7 PM, with the chance of precipitation sitting at a robust 80%, hinting at a wet night ahead.\n\nGiven these conditions, the scene at the beach might appear subdued, with low wave action that could be suited for contemplative strolls rather than vigorous activities. As the forecast leans towards rain, dressing in layers with a waterproof outer layer would be wise to stay comfortable throughout the day. This time of year traditionally sees temperatures fluctuating in this mid to upper 50s range, aligning well with seasonal norms in this region, though the chill may leave many residents longing for the warm embrace of summer. For today, light outdoor activities early on could be pleasant, but with rain on the horizon, planning for indoor pastimes by evening would be prudent.",
