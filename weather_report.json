    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current conditions present a cool and brisk scene with temperatures in the low 50s and a noticeable breeze stirring up the air, making it feel refreshing yet slightly chilly. The day is mostly clear, inviting glimpses of sunshine, although the forecast predicts a shift later on, with clouds rolling in and a chance of drizzle later this evening. In terms of wave conditions, the waters of Lake Michigan may be slightly choppy due to the gusty winds but remain inviting for a peaceful stroll along the beach.\n\nAs for attire, a light jacket or sweater is advisable to fend off the cooler afternoon air, especially if venturing out later when temperatures are expected to dip to the mid 40s. This December weather aligns with typical seasonal temperatures, providing that crisp, wintry feel, just perfect for enjoying a walk along the shoreline or engaging in light outdoor activities as we embrace the full swing of the holiday season. While today isn\u2019t a major holiday, the atmosphere is buoyed by the festive spirit that often accompanies this time of year, setting the stage for enjoyable outings in the refreshing winter air.",
