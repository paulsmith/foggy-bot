    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly atmosphere, with temperatures lingering in the mid-30s and a noticeable breeze creating a brisk sensation. The day is dominated by a blanket of clouds, imparting a somewhat dreary appearance to the landscape, particularly as twilight approaches. Wave conditions along Lake Michigan reflect the gusty winds, likely producing moderate surf, but no warnings are in place. \n\nAs the evening unfolds, the forecast predicts snow likely after midnight, further cloaking the area in winter\u2019s embrace with temperatures settling near the low 30s. A chance of light accumulation suggests a gentle dusting rather than a major snowfall, making for a lovely winter scene. Given the conditions, a warm coat, gloves, and a hat are advisable for anyone planning to venture outdoors, especially as daylight fades and the chill sets in. Although today is a typical December day in this region, the predicted snow may offer an opportunity for festive winter activities in the coming days, coinciding with the holiday spirit in the air.",
