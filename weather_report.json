    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston are characterized by a cool and damp atmosphere, with temperatures lingering in the low 40s amidst persistent rain and areas of fog. The air is thick with moisture, contributing to a rather heavy sensation as the day unfolds. The forecast indicates a continuation of rain along with a slight chance of thunderstorms until mid-afternoon, transitioning briefly to mixed rain and snow in the late afternoon. Winds will be brisk from the north-northeast, creating a blustery, wintry feel.\n\nWith expected high temperatures barely reaching the low 40s but dropping to the mid-30s as the afternoon progresses, it\u2019s worth noting that such temperatures are typical for this time of year in Evanston. The conditions may render the beach and waterfront less appealing for outdoor activities, as the waves could rise due to the blustery conditions, bringing a churning appearance to Lake Michigan. It\u2019s advisable to dress warmly in layers, considering a waterproof layer to guard against the steady rain. Given the current dreary conditions, indoor activities, perhaps a visit to a local museum or caf\u00e9, would be more suitable than venturing to the beach today.",
