    "weather_report": "Today in Evanston, the atmosphere hangs in a chilly embrace, with current temperatures dipping into the low 30s, beneath a canopy of clouds. The air feels damp yet faintly crisp, inviting warm layers to shield against the cold. As the day transitions, temperatures are expected to edge towards the high 30s in the afternoon, giving way to blustery west winds that will gust fiercely, stirring the waters of Lake Michigan as well. Tonight promises a drop into the teens, but the cloud cover will begin to clear, allowing for a more open night sky.\n\nWith no precipitation currently in the mix, the scene at the beach might be relatively calm, although the churning waves hint at the turbulent winds to come. Those venturing outdoors are advised to dress warmly\u2014think heavy coats, scarves, and perhaps a hat, especially with the wild gusts that may sweep through. For this time of year, temperatures are right on the edge of typical for February in the Midwest, where the chill is often a familiar companion. It\u2019s an ideal moment for indoor pursuits or a brisk walk along the lakefront, soaking in the winter scenery while thoughtfully bundled up against the cold.",
