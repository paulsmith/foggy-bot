    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly atmosphere, with temperatures in the mid-20s and a brisk, almost howling wind making it feel rather nippy. The day is mostly clear, contributing to a sense of brightness despite the cold. The forecast for the afternoon promises sunnier skies with a high approaching the low 30s, though it will drop back to the mid-teens tonight. Wave conditions near Lake Michigan are likely to be affected by gusty winds, which could create a bit of a tumultuous ride on the water, making it less than ideal for casual beachside enjoyment.\n\nAs for attire, it's wise to bundle up, opting for warm layers, hats, and gloves to fend off the sharp chill. This time of year is typical for winter in the Midwest, where frigid temperatures are to be expected. As the day unfolds, there's a perfect opportunity for a brisk walk along the shore or through local parks, taking in the crisp air and clear sky\u2014a refreshing experience amid the cold. Given that there are no major holidays today, residents can focus on enjoying simple winter activities instead.",
