    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current scene is quite frigid, with temperatures hovering in the low teens, creating a stark winter chill that is accompanied by moderate winds slicing through the air. The conditions are clear, offering a crisp view of the surroundings, though the breeze may momentarily bite against exposed skin. Looking ahead to the forecast, a mild warming trend is anticipated, with sunny skies expected to bring a high near the low 30s on Friday, perfect for those seeking a touch of winter sunshine.\n\nWith no precipitation on the immediate horizon, the day looks to be pleasantly dry, despite the chill. As for wave conditions along Lake Michigan, they may reflect a bit of agitation typical for this season, with a gentle surf that complements the winter landscape. For those venturing outdoors, layered attire will be essential; consider wearing a warm coat, gloves, and a hat to ward off the cold. The current temperatures align with typical winter standards for the Midwest, which often sees such chilly conditions at this time of year. Engaging in winter activities like a beach stroll or photography may be fitting, especially with the promise of sun tomorrow.",
