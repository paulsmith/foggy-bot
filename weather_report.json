    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the night air is crisp and cool, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s. The atmosphere is thick with cloud cover, giving the environment a somewhat muted appearance. With no wind to stir the night, any outdoor activity may feel a bit more biting due to the chill in the air. As we look ahead, expect snow likely to begin after midnight, with a 60% chance of precipitation possibly bringing a light dusting of less than half an inch. Tomorrow morning could see a slight chance of snow before 8 AM, giving way to some breaks in the clouds as the day progresses. Highs will barely reach the mid 30s.\n\nGiven these conditions, it's advisable to bundle up in warm layers should you venture out, with a good coat, gloves, and a scarf to fend off the chill. As for wave conditions on Lake Michigan, expect them to be gentle, providing a serene backdrop to the wintry scene. While the beach may not be the ideal venue for midday recreation, consider cozy indoor activities with friends or family to combat the impending wintry weather. Reflecting the season, these temperatures align with typical December conditions in this region, marking a classic winter night in the Midwest.",
