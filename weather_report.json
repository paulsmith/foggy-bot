    "weather_report": "In Evanston today, current conditions are a brisk mix of cool temperatures and a subtle dampness in the air, with readings resting in the mid-30s. It's a day where the clouds reign over the sky, creating a milky, subdued light that may feel dreary. As the afternoon progresses, expect an increase in temperature, peaking near the high 30s, but winds from the west will bring only a gentle breeze, making it feel slightly colder than the thermometer suggests. \n\nAs night approaches, snow is likely to blanket the area after midnight, with a 70% chance of light accumulation. A calm wind from the west-northwest, gusting occasionally, will create that familiar wintry atmosphere. Given the cooling temperatures and potential for snow, dressing warmly with layers is advisable, ideally including a heavy coat, scarf, and gloves. Despite the chill, the scenery by the lake offers a serene winter charm. For those seeking outdoor activities, consider a peaceful walk along the lakeshore or enjoying the muted beauty of the landscape, but be mindful of the impending snow later in the evening.",
