    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently experiencing a blustery late afternoon with temperatures settling in the low 40s, making for a cool yet somewhat damp vibe as the air feels heavier under the overcast skies. With a gusty northeast wind adding to the chill, it's definitely a good idea to bundle up. Throughout the afternoon, expect mostly cloudy conditions as temperatures hover around 45 before dipping again, accompanied by scattered rain showers arriving later tonight between 9 PM and 3 AM. The presence of rain could bring a sense of melancholy to what is already a rather dreary end to the day.\n\nAs for the waves on Lake Michigan, expect them to be a bit choppy given the winds, so not the ideal setting for a relaxed beach outing. Tonight's forecast suggests a low around 31, rising slightly as the night progresses, so keep in mind the potential for a few wet spots. Ideal attire would include a warm coat and perhaps a waterproof layer if venturing out later. Given it\u2019s late November, these temperatures are par for the course in the Midwest, fitting within the typical cool and brisk seasonal expectations. For activities, a cozy evening in sounds preferable, perhaps enjoying some indoor leisure or planning for the upcoming holiday season as Thanksgiving is just days away.",
