    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston are marked by a brisk chill, with temperatures hovering in the mid-30s. A gentle breeze from the northwest adds a biting edge to the air, creating a distinctly cool feel that may encourage layering for warmth if venturing outside. The night sky is mostly clear, promising a tranquil ambiance as the city transitions into the early hours of Tuesday.\n\nAs we look forward to the day ahead, expect a beautiful shift as temperatures climb into the high 40s by midday, under mostly sunny skies. While the wind may become a little gustier in the afternoon, it will feel invigorating rather than oppressive. This winter day in Evanston shows little to no chance of precipitation, a welcome respite for those longing for outdoor activity. Given the season, the temperatures are comfortably chilly but typical for late January in this northern city\u2014a perfect opportunity for a brisk walk or a leisurely stroll along the beach, embracing the beauty of Lake Michigan as the sun shines down.",
