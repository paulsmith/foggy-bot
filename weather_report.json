    "weather_report": "In Evanston today, a gray, chilly atmosphere settles over the beach as temperatures linger in the mid 30s. The air is damp, presenting a crispness that adds to the overall chilliness, especially against a backdrop of swaying waves coming from Lake Michigan. Winds are brisk from the northeast, causing a noticeable chill, and the clouds lend an overcast feel, making the day appear more subdued. \n\nAs for the forecast for this Christmas Day, expect patchy fog in the afternoon alongside the possibility of light drizzle. Temperatures are projected to reach around the low 40s, but will begin to drop again later on, bringing a touch of winter to the celebrations. Wave conditions are likely choppy due to the winds, making it less than ideal for leisurely strolls along the shore. Given the dampness and chill, layered attire including a warm coat is advisable, along with waterproof gear if venturing outside\u2014perfect for anyone looking to enjoy the cozy indoor atmosphere common on this holiday. While the weather might deter outdoor activities, it sets a reflective tone, making for a lovely day spent indoors with family and friends.",
