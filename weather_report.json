    "weather_report": "This morning in Evanston, the weather is decidedly brisk with temperatures hovering in the mid-20s and a noticeable chill brought on by a blustery wind, which is pushing from the east. The overcast skies blanket the area, creating a somewhat somber but characteristic winter ambiance. As the day unfolds, there is a slight chance of snow early on, followed by cloudy conditions and a gradual warming trend, with highs reaching into the low 30s later in the afternoon. \n\nPrecipitation is more likely tonight with an 80% chance of freezing drizzle, possibly accompanied by some snow as the temperatures rise slightly towards the evening. Given the current season, these temperatures are typical for early February in the Midwest, and residents are advised to dress warmly. Layers are essential today; a sturdy winter coat, gloves, and a hat will go a long way in combating the wind chill. As for activities, outdoor pursuits may be limited, but for those willing, a brisk walk along the waterfront or a visit to local cafes may be just the ticket to enjoy a taste of winter's charm.",
