    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a brisk, chilly atmosphere with temperatures in the low 50s, accompanied by a noticeable breeze that dances through the area, bringing a sense of invigorating freshness. The sky above is mostly clear, though the view hints at the possibility of clouds gathering later in the day. As the afternoon approaches, we can expect scattered rain showers after 3 PM, presenting a shift to a predominantly cloudy sky. High temperatures are set to hover around the high 40s, with a gradual drop to the low 40s as the day progresses. Winds from the west-southwest at 20 mph may intensify to gusts near 35 mph, adding to the raw feel of the day.\n\nAs evening unfolds, scattered snow showers are anticipated, coupled with temperatures dipping to around 30 degrees. Given this mix of rain and snow, it's advisable to bundle up in layered clothing\u2014think warm jackets, scarves, and gloves to stay comfortable. The conditions by the beach might not be for sunbathers this time of year, but for adventurous souls, a brisk walk along the shore could be invigorating, as long as they come prepared for some wind and potential rain. With Thanksgiving just around the corner, the cooler temperatures are a reminder that winter is fast approaching in this part of the Midwest.",
