    "weather_report": "Currently in Evanston, the air is crisp and cool with temperatures hovering in the mid-30s. Despite the brisk weather, conditions remain predominantly clear, allowing for glimpses of blue sky above the tranquil waters of Lake Michigan. The winds are howling from the southwest, creating a noticeable chill that calls for a light jacket if you venture outside. \n\nAs we move into the afternoon, expect the sun to shine favorably, with temperatures peaking near the upper 30s before declining slightly. Tonight brings a shift, as the skies grow cloudy with a slight chance of rain and snow late in the evening. With those clouds rolling in, it\u2019s advisable to prepare for the potential of light precipitation. Overall, the day portrays a sharp seasonal feel typical for late November in this region, where a warm scarf and a sturdy pair of boots may serve you well. Despite the cooler temperatures, the beach could be a serene spot for a brisk walk or a moment of reflection, as the still waters and shifting winds create a placid atmosphere, weighted only by the hints of winter to come.",
