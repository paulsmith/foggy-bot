    "weather_report": "Evanston, Illinois is experiencing a distinctly cloudy afternoon with temperatures settling comfortably in the mid to upper 60s. The air is damp, typical for this time of year, as the region transitions from a milder fall into the cooler months ahead. As the day progresses, a sense of heaviness hangs in the atmosphere, heralding the potential for rain later. Waves on Lake Michigan are likely gentle, with a calm surface reflecting the gray sky overhead.\n\nThis evening, expect an uptick in precipitation as rain and possible thunderstorms move in, particularly before 7 PM. With temperatures dropping to the low 60s, the forecast calls for a decidedly cozy atmosphere, best complemented by warm layers and perhaps a waterproof jacket to prepare for the anticipated showers and gusty winds reaching up to 25 mph. For those considering outdoor activities, it may be wise to enjoy any last sunlit moments before the rain arrives, potentially engaging in a brief stroll along the beach or a visit to a local caf\u00e9. Keep in mind that today comes without the celebration of a holiday, but it offers a true taste of the changing seasons as winter approaches.",
