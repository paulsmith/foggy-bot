    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois, reveal a chilly day marked by a cloud-covered sky, with temperatures hovering in the low 50s. The air carries a brisk, gusty wind, giving the scene a fresh chill that keeps one alert. With mostly cloudy skies prevailing, the outlook for the afternoon suggests a high near 53, as temperatures gently dip back towards the 50-degree mark. As night approaches, scattered rain showers are anticipated between 7 PM and 4 AM, with a slightly cooler low settling around the mid-30s. Wave conditions along Lake Michigan could be turbulent due to the prominent winds, creating a dynamic atmosphere at the water\u2019s edge.\n\nThose venturing out later will want to dress warmly, especially anticipating evening showers and the drop in temperature. A layered approach\u2014perhaps a warm coat and sturdy footwear\u2014would keep one comfortable. Today\u2019s temperatures are typical for late February in this part of the Midwest, embodying the transitional feel before spring's arrival. For outdoor activities, it might be best to plan for a quick stroll or a visit to a local caf\u00e9, taking advantage of the daylight hours before the rain begins to fall.",
