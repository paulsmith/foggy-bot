    "weather_report": "As the sun begins its descent over Lake Michigan, Evanston lays in mostly cloudy conditions with temperatures hovering in the upper 30s. The air feels brisk and invigorating, with a notable wind creating a rather blustery atmosphere as it sweeps across the shores. Waves gently lap against the beach, presenting calm conditions but with a hint of chill that suggests today\u2019s temperatures may drop further, especially as evening approaches. No significant precipitation is expected until later tonight, when a slight chance of snow comes into play, yet it appears that little to no accumulation will occur.\n\nLooking ahead, this afternoon offers a brief period of partly sunny skies before the clouds regroup. Temperatures should settle around the mid to upper 30s, with a gentle breeze contributing to an overall cool evening atmosphere. It would be wise to dress warmly in layers, opting for a good coat and perhaps a scarf, as this late November day in the Midwest aligns with typical seasonal norms. As the day winds down, consider enjoying a stroll along the beach or a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, taking advantage of the peaceful lakeside views while the chance of light snow adds a touch of winter charm to the evening.",
