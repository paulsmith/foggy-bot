    "weather_report": "As of this afternoon, Evanston, Illinois, is experiencing cool, blustery conditions with temperatures in the mid 30s. The day is mostly cloudy, and the air carries a biting chill, driven by fierce winds that sweep across the shoreline. Expect scattered rain and occasional snow showers as the afternoon progresses, with temperatures likely dipping toward the low 30s. Given a 50% chance of precipitation, it\u2019s prudent to prepare for a mix of rain and snow, but little to no accumulation is expected.\n\nAs evening approaches, the temperature will drop significantly, creating an atmosphere that feels sharper and more severe, with wind chill values plunging to the negatives. Scattered snow showers will linger, adding to the cold and cloudy ambiance, and gusty winds will persist throughout the night, making for a wild, wintry feel. Those venturing outdoors should don warm layers, including a heavy coat, gloves, and a hat to combat the cold. Given that we are in early December, the current temperatures align well with typical seasonal expectations, though the fierce winds may lend an edge of discomfort. With these conditions, it\u2019s best to engage in indoor activities today, perhaps cozying up with a good book or catching up on holiday preparations, as outdoor ventures may be less than inviting.",
