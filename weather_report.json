    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Evanston, the air is crisp and slightly damp, with temperatures lingering in the mid to upper 40s, accompanied by a gentle breeze whispering from the south southwest. The prevailing conditions are predominantly cloudy, hinting at the possibility of rain showers throughout the day, particularly during the overnight hours when the chance stands at 20%. While the weather this Sunday may feel cool, it remains significantly overshadowed by the excitement of the upcoming winter season. \n\nToday, expect a gradual climb to the high 50s by afternoon, though temperatures may fall later in the day. With gusts reaching up to 25 miles per hour, the winds will add a blustery chill to the atmosphere, making it sensible to layer up. The beach along Lake Michigan may have some enticing waves, yet swimming is not advisable given the temperature and potential precipitation. Outdoor enthusiasts might consider a brisk walk along the shore or a visit to local cafes, as the weather holds a certain charm, albeit slightly dampened by the cloud cover. While this Sunday is not a recognized holiday, the atmosphere carries a distinctively cozy feel that encourages preparation for the festive season ahead.",
