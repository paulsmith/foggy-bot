    "weather_report": "As dawn approaches in Evanston, the air is crisp and cool, with current temperatures lingering in the mid 30s. The atmosphere is fairly humid, giving it a slightly clingy feel, and a playful wind whispers from the west at 29 miles per hour, adding a touch of briskness to the scene. The sky, mostly clear now, hints at a shift to predominantly cloudy conditions overnight, with temperatures expected to dip further down to around the low 30s. Tomorrow, the characters of the day will shift even more dramatically, as cloud cover prevails and the high struggles to reach the upper 30s, with gentle winds.\n\nGiven these conditions, the beach might not beckon to sunbathers but rather to solitary thinkers, bundled against the chill, or perhaps even a brisk walk for those invigorated by the fresh air. The wave conditions along Lake Michigan are likely to be moderate, with the wind creating some lively ripples, ideal for contemplative souls gazing out at the horizon. As for attire, layering is advisable\u2014think warm jackets and cozy hats to keep the chill at bay. While today's weather may feel somewhat wintry for December, it remains typical for this time of year in the Midwest, signaling the deep grip of a classic northern winter. With no significant holidays or events on the calendar today, it\u2019s a quiet moment for reflection before the festivities of the upcoming season unfold.",
