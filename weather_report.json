    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the air is thick with humidity, creating a damp and chilly atmosphere. Current temperatures sit in the upper 40s, accompanied by a gusty wind that sweeps in from the south, making for a brisk experience outdoors. The scene is further shadowed by light drizzle and dense fog, reducing visibility and amplifying the sense of a moody late fall night.\n\nThe forecast for the coming hours suggests a continuation of patchy drizzle and fog, with temperatures expected to rise slightly overnight. By Sunday, we can anticipate similar conditions, with a chance of rain showers throughout the day, primarily after noon. The high will creep up to the low 60s, while a steady breeze may pick up, adding a chill to the air. For those brave enough to venture outside, the beach scene may be less inviting due to the dreary weather, with waves likely subdued, concealing the usual vibrancy of the shoreline. It\u2019s a time to bundle up\u2014think layers with waterproof outerwear to fend off the persistent moisture in the air. While outdoor activities might be limited, cozying up with a good book or enjoying indoor hobbies could be a pleasant way to spend the day, especially as we near a holiday season filled with warmth and festivity.",
