    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current conditions are decidedly brisk, as temperatures hover in the low 20s, accentuated by a biting wind that brings a fierce chill to the air. The scene is mostly clouded, casting a grayish hue over the beach as gusts whip through at formidable speeds, creating a blustery environment, perfect for those equipped to face the cold. As the day progresses, expect the afternoon to remain mostly cloudy with a high reaching near the mid-teens, while tonight will usher in partly cloudy skies and a dropping temperature that may dip to the single digits, alongside wind chill values that could feel as low as negative figures.\n\nGiven the current temperature and the atmospheric feel, this evening lends itself to a rather unwelcome chill, suggesting a need for layered clothing if venturing outdoors. The water conditions along the Lake Michigan shore may appear turbulent, reflective of the winds and cooler temperatures, ideal only for hardened winter enthusiasts or those simply relishing the serene, albeit harsh winter landscape. While outdoor activities might be limited, a brisk walk for the hearty and warm drinks at local cafes could provide a pleasant reprieve from the cold. Today is not recognized as a major holiday, but with the winter season upon us, it definitely captures the spirit of the chilly months typical for this region.",
