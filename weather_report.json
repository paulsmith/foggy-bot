    "weather_report": "As evening approaches in Evanston, the temperature hovers in the low 30s, giving the air a chilly bite amidst the cloudy skies. With a blustery wind sweeping in from the west-northwest, it feels colder than the thermometer might suggest, the wind carrying the promise of winter. Forecasters anticipate a high of near 36 degrees this afternoon, with temperatures gradually easing down to the upper 20s tonight, maintaining that brisk, wintry feel.\n\nThe waves on Lake Michigan reflect the day's overcast ambiance, likely presenting a gentle swell without any significant precipitation to disrupt the view. Conditions appear pleasant yet brisk, ideal for a quick stroll along the beach wrapped in warm attire. Given the current season, these temperatures are typical for December in this region, reminding residents of the colder months ahead. Although outdoor activities might be limited due to the chill, those willing to embrace winter could find solace in a quiet moment by the lake as nature settles into its wintry rhythm.",
