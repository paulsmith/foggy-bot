Throughout the day, clouds will dominate the sky and, as temperatures gradually dip to around 40, the piercing wind adds to an overall brisk demeanor. \n\nLooking ahead, tonight brings potential for patchy fog and drizzle, with temperatures dropping to the mid-30s and winds calming to a light whisper from the southwest. Given these conditions, the landscape appears somber and subdued, best appreciated from the warmth of inside\u2014a cozy spot with a view of Lake Michigan would be ideal. Wave conditions may be moderate, adding an inviting charm to the otherwise cool ambiance. For those venturing out, it would be wise to dress warmly in layers, embracing the season's typical chill. As for activities, it might be a perfect evening for a quiet stroll along the lakeshore, or perhaps settling in with a good book by the window as festive preparations hint at the upcoming holiday season.",
