    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a cool atmosphere, marked by temperatures in the low 40s and a rather breezy demeanor, with winds whipping in from the west at about 25 mph, creating a brisk feel as one steps outside. The skies are overcast, casting a muted light over the beach, where the calm lake reflects the somber sky. As the day unfolds, there\u2019s a likelihood of precipitation as light rain gives way to potential snow showers later on, especially this evening, with temperatures expected to dip into the low 30s.\n\nThe forecast suggests a day of changing weather, starting with a chance of rain in the morning, which could make the scene appear gloomy and wet. The wave conditions in the lake are likely to be gentle, making it a less-than-ideal time for boating or water activities. Those venturing outdoors should consider warm layers, due to the chill in the air combined with the brisk winds. It's a typical day for late November in this region, as folks prepare for the impending winter. Given the current time frame, staying cozy indoors with a book or engaging in local coffee shop explorations might be the most delightful way to enjoy the day.",
