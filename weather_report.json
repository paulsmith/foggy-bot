    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather presents a chilly tableau, with temperatures hovering in the mid-30s, accentuated by a damp chill that lingers in the air. The night sky is mostly clear, though a slight chance of rain may drift in before dawn, stirring the air with a gentle breeze. Wind gusts, brisk and assertive from the northwest, are clocking in around 29 miles per hour, lending a fierce edge to the otherwise serene lakeside atmosphere. \n\nAs we look forward to Friday, the forecast predicts a cloudy day with highs reaching into the upper 40s, gradually falling through the afternoon. Given the cool and drizzly outlook, it\u2019s advisable to dress in layers and bring an umbrella or raincoat if venturing outdoors. The wave conditions along the shore of Lake Michigan are likely to be moderate, creating a rugged beauty along the beach that could be invigorating for those who brave the elements. In light of the damp chill, activities may be better suited for cozy indoor gatherings or brisk, bundled-up walks rather than beach outings. As this falls on the eve of Thanksgiving, the air is filled with anticipation as families prepare to gather, making the atmosphere both reflective and festive as the holiday approaches.",
