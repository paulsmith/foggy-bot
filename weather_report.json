    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the air is chilly, with a temperature dipping into the low 40s and a dampness that gives it a raw edge, thanks to a gentle breeze coming from the northeast. The current conditions reflect the wintry grip of the season; it's a stark reminder that winter isn't quite ready to loosen its hold. The beach view looks overcast, with the potential for rain and patchy fog rolling in overnight, maintaining a likelihood of precipitation at 50%. As we move through Sunday, expect persistent rain to drench the area, with temperatures falling throughout the day, reaching highs near 43 before slipping into the cooler realm of the late afternoon.\n\nWith the expected rain, the beach may not present its usual allure. The surf will likely churn with rough wave conditions, making any beach walks less than pleasant. For those venturing outdoors, insulated and waterproof attire is advisable, complemented by sturdy boots to navigate through possible puddles. While the temperature is reflective of late December in the Midwest, the combination of moisture and wind creates an atmosphere that could be described as dreary and unfriendly. Indoor activities, such as visiting local cafes or enjoying a cozy afternoon in a bookstore, would be more suited to these conditions, allowing one to stay warm and dry as the precipitation falls steadily from the sky.",
