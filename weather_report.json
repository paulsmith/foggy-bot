    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Evanston, the weather presents a pleasantly cool scene, with the temperature hovering in the mid 20s, a crisp chill in the air that hints at the essence of winter. The skies are mostly clear, offering a bright sun that lifts spirits even as the cold persists. As we progress into the afternoon, temperatures are expected to rise slightly, but don't expect much more than the upper 20s, accompanied by a brisk northwest wind blowing at a robust pace, creating a refreshing bite that may encourage layering up if you decide to venture outside. \n\nTonight, the weather will transition to partly cloudy skies, with lows dipping into the teens, emphasizing the unmistakably wintry feel of December in the Midwest. Conditions at the beach will be marked by moderate wave activity in Lake Michigan, creating a picturesque, if not a little frosty, view of the shoreline. For attire, consider bundling up with a warm coat, gloves, and perhaps a knitted hat, perfect for enjoying an invigorating walk along the water\u2019s edge. This time of year typically brings such chilly conditions to the region, and while it may be too bracing for all outdoor activities, a brisk walk or simply soaking in the serene winter landscape might just be the perfect remedy for a midweek day.",
