    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois, paint a brisk scene with a chilly temperature hovering in the mid-30s and a thick blanket of clouds overhead. The atmosphere feels quite damp and raw, characteristic of a wintry day, as gusts begin to pick up from the north, creating a blustery ambiance. Today's forecast hints at a 70% chance of snow showers, raising the possibility of light accumulation, with temperatures expected to dip into the low 30s by afternoon. As the day progresses, the likelihood of snow will heighten, making for a rather gloomy outlook at the beach, where the waves of Lake Michigan might be rolling in with a spirited chop, influenced by the invigorating winds.\n\nAs night falls, temperatures will chill further, sinking to the upper teens; thus, dressing warmly is essential for any outdoor activities. Layering with a sturdy coat, gloves, and a hat is prudent to combat the biting cold. In keeping with the season, these conditions are certainly typical for December in the Midwest, where such temperatures and potential snowfall are par for the course. With the chilly weather and possible precipitation, outside activities may be limited to quick errands or a brisk walk. Given the short days leading to the holiday season, it\u2019s an excellent time for cozy indoor pursuits or preparations for upcoming celebrations.",
