    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current scene is marked by a chilly temperature in the low 30s, accompanied by light snow that adds a delicate layer to the already damp conditions. The atmosphere feels crisp and cool, enhanced by a gentle breeze that stirs the air but isn\u2019t overly biting. As the day unfolds, clouds will dominate the sky with a forecast calling for a chance of more snow showers. Highs will near the mid-30s, dropping slightly as afternoon wears on, while a more blustery north wind will pick up, gusting into the 20s, bringing a sharpness to the air. By nightfall, temperatures will dip to the low 20s, with a calmer wind settling in.\n\nUnderneath the cloudy blanket, the lake near the beach presents itself with a slightly tumultuous character, where you can expect moderate waves reflecting the startled nature of the weather. While the day may not offer clear views, it could serve as a peaceful backdrop for indoor activities or short strolls, bundled up warmly. As we inch closer to the holidays, the seasonal chill is entirely typical for this time of year. Layering up with a warm coat, gloves, and a hat will be essential for outdoor ventures, providing a cozy escape amidst the winter elements.",
