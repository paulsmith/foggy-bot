    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather sets a brisk tone, with temperatures hovering in the mid-20s, creating a chilling atmosphere complemented by blustery winds from the northwest. The sky remains mostly clear, offering a stark contrast to the biting cold, and while the strong winds may whip through town, visibility remains decent over the landscape leading toward Lake Michigan. As Thanksgiving approaches, today's forecast hints at a partly sunny day with highs reaching near 36 degrees, before dipping to around 32 this afternoon. Locals can expect winds to remain gentle to brisk, with occasional gusts that could elevate the chill factor even further.\n\nAs daylight breaks, the beach may appear inviting yet unwelcoming due to the cold. While precipitation is unlikely during the day, a slight chance of snow showers could greet residents later tonight, adding a wintry touch as temperatures descend closer to the low 20s. Given these conditions, it\u2019s advisable to dress warmly, opting for insulated layers, hats, and gloves for those braving the outdoors. This chilly weather is typical for late November in the Midwest, signaling a shift fully into winter, an ideal time for cozy gatherings, albeit fewer outdoor activities. However, if one fancies a stroll by the lake or enjoys crisp air and solitude, don\u2019t miss the serene beauty of Evanston\u2019s beach in this biting chill.",
