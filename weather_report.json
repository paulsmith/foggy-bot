    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly atmosphere, with temperatures lingering in the mid 30s and moisture in the air creating a gloomy setting. A brisk wind from the west-northwest adds to the biting chill, and the skies are dominated by thick clouds. Overnight, expect patchy fog to settle in after 5 AM, under a blanket of clouds, with temperatures dipping slightly. The forecast for Monday hints at continued coolness, featuring a high in the upper 30s and lingering fog until mid-afternoon. \n\nThe lake\u2019s demeanor is mixed today, with choppy waves making for less than ideal conditions for water activities. Although no significant precipitation is anticipated, the overall grayness could make for an uninviting outdoor experience. Dress warmly; layered gloves and a sturdy coat are essential for comfort. While these temperatures are typical for this time of year in the Midwest, the moisture adds a layer of discomfort. This last weekend of the year might not inspire outdoor excursions, yet short walks along the shoreline could be a serene option for those seeking a breath of fresh, albeit crisp, air as the year draws to a close.",
