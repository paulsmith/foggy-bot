    "weather_report": "Current weather conditions in Evanston feel distinctly chilly, with temperatures in the low 50s and a thick layer of fog shrouding the beach. The air is damp and cool, leading to an atmosphere that's a touch dreary. Winds are brisk, coming from the west-southwest, creating a slightly blustery feel as they whip across the shoreline. Today's forecast suggests that the fog will linger until mid-morning, so visibility may be limited. Expect mostly cloudy skies, with highs reaching near 50 degrees before a drop in temperatures during the afternoon. As the day progresses, it seems likely that a gentle rain may pass through, adding to the dampness felt in the air earlier.\n\nWave conditions on Lake Michigan appear modest today; the surface may be smooth, but with the wind's gusts, caution is advised for any water activities. With the forecast indicating a rise in temperature overnight to the mid-30s, it\u2019s recommended to dress warmly in layers if venturing outside, perhaps including a coat and a scarf to fend off the chill. As we find ourselves deep in December, these temperatures are somewhat typical for this time of year in the Midwest. Though activities may be limited, a short stroll along the beach could still be refreshing, particularly with the peaceful ambiance created by the fog and the gentle sound of waves lapping at the shore.",
