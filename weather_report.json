    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current conditions are marked by a chill in the air as temperatures hover in the mid-30s, accompanied by a blustery wind that creates a biting feel outside. The cloudy sky adds to an overall somber atmosphere, which, combined with the high wind speeds, may deter those who aren\u2019t prepared for a brisk outing. As we look ahead, expect a similarly cool night with temperatures dipping into the mid-20s, though they'll rise slightly as the night progresses. Tomorrow brings a slight chance of snow, particularly in the morning, while skies will show some breaks, allowing for partly sunny moments. Temperatures will again struggle, peaking around 28, and accompanied by a steady north wind.\n\nWave conditions along Lake Michigan could likely be choppy given the wind's intensity, making this an unattractive day for water activities. Dress warmly, layering up to fend off the cold and wind\u2014think insulated jackets, hats, and gloves. As we are in February, these temperatures are typical for the Midwest during winter, reinforcing that you should definitely expect cold, wintry conditions in this region at this time of year. Outdoor activities will be limited, but those seeking fresh air might enjoy a brisk walk along the beach, provided they bundle up against the chill.",
