    "weather_report": "As the sun slips below the horizon in Evanston, the current temperature hovers in the low 30s, creating a crisp, chilly atmosphere, especially with a ferocious westward wind sweeping through at nearly 30 miles per hour. The air feels biting, making it imperative to bundle up as you step outside. Tonight\u2019s forecast promises mostly clear skies with temperatures dropping to the low 20s. The winds will ease, shifting to a more gentle breeze of 10 to 15 miles per hour, providing a slight respite from the earlier gustiness.\n\nLooking to tomorrow, residents can anticipate a predominantly sunny day, although temperatures will only climb to around the mid-40s before beginning to drop again in the afternoon. Wind will pick up again, ranging from brisk to howling, with potential gusts hitting 50 miles per hour. The absence of precipitation ensures a dry slate for activities, but the substantial wind combined with the cold will create a biting chill. It\u2019s advisable to wear warm layers, including a heavy coat, gloves, and perhaps a scarf. Winter is firmly established in this region, making these temperatures typical for this time of year. A good day to enjoy the invigorating conditions, perhaps a brisk walk along Lake Michigan or enjoying a warm beverage while admiring the tranquil lake views, as the shoreline bristles with the remnants of winter's grip.",
