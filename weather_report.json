    "weather_report": "The current weather in Evanston, Illinois, presents a chilly picture, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s and a noticeable bite in the air, exacerbated by a brisk, gusty north wind. Light snow flurries mingle with fog, creating a gray haze that envelops the beachfront, casting a melancholic yet serene aura. As we move through this afternoon, snow is expected to intensify, with temperatures nudging slightly higher, maintaining a solid chill. Preparations for around half an inch of fresh snow should be made, and with the skies coated in clouds, visibility may remain hampered.\n\nHeading into the evening, snow showers will likely persist, with temperatures gradually rising to the high 20s, though the wind will continue to howl, creating an environment reminiscent of the colder months. Although the beach may not be the prime location for activities today, bundled layers, sturdy boots, and a warm hat are essential for those who venture out to appreciate the brisk air and soft snowflakes. While this February chill is typical for the region, the mild snowfall paired with gusty winds may make outdoor activities less appealing. Perhaps a cozy evening indoors or a brisk walk to enjoy the quiet beauty of a snowy lakefront would be the more fortifying option on this dreary day.",
