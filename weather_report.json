    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a chilly evening characterized by a brisk breeze coming from the southwest. As temperatures remain in the mid to high 30s, the atmosphere feels noticeably cool and damp, enveloping the beach area in a layer of clouds that makes the setting dark and subdued. Tonight, patchy fog is expected to develop after 11 PM, complementing the general cloudiness and creating a somewhat atmospheric but uninviting scene. \n\nLooking to tomorrow, residents can anticipate a slightly warmer day with temperatures rising to the low 50s, especially with the promise of some sunshine after the early morning fog lifts. The wind will be gentler, making outdoor excursions more enjoyable as the day progresses. While there are no immediate concerns of precipitation, the lingering fog and cloud cover can obscure the brightening views over Lake Michigan. Dress warmly for the evening, perhaps including a light jacket and layers, and consider enjoying the clear conditions that the afternoon has in store, which could be perfect for a stroll along the shoreline or through nearby parks. As we inch toward the holiday season, with Thanksgiving just passed, the atmosphere is set to be reflective\u2014a great time for contemplative walks or casual outings with family.",
