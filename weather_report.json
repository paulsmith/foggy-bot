    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the evening is marked by a cool dampness as temperatures rest comfortably in the low 40s, surrounded by a shroud of clouds that lends the scene a moody, contemplative air. The brisk breeze from the south is quite noticeable, moving with a spirited intensity that could make for a rather blustery outing if one steps outside. As night falls, areas of fog are anticipated, mingling with possible patchy drizzle, creating an environment that evokes the quiet charm of a winter evening beside Lake Michigan. \n\nLooking ahead to Monday, early risers can expect lingering fog and a chance of rain before the sun takes center stage. The day may start overcast, but there's promise of a gradual shift as temperatures move upwards, peaking near the lower 50s, only to drop again in the afternoon. While rain showers are expected to remain light, they could further contribute to the chilly atmosphere. Given the season, these temperatures are typical for December in the Midwest, encapsulating that crisp, wintry feel. Layering up is advisable\u2014think warm sweaters and perhaps a waterproof jacket for those venturing outside, particularly for a stroll along the beach or a quick visit to local parks. While a brisk walk by the water may appeal to the more adventurous, those preferring to stay warm can find solace indoors, perhaps with a comforting hot drink in hand.",
