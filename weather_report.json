    "weather_report": "Current weather conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly scene, with temperatures hovering in the low 20s, accompanied by light snow that blankets the landscape. Humidity adds a touch of crispness, enhancing the cold feel as gusty winds ripple across Lake Michigan, bringing a biting chill to the air. As the day progresses, intermittent snow showers are anticipated, with cloudy skies prevailing and temperatures expected to peak just above 25 before dipping back toward 24 in the afternoon. Despite the snow, with winds steadily pushing from the west at 15 to 20 mph, the overall visibility may remain obscured, resulting in a gray, somewhat uninviting atmosphere.\n\nAs daylight wanes, the forecast promises mostly clear skies tonight, allowing for a drop to the mid-teens. The forecast temperature reflects typical late November conditions for this region, where the air remains brisk and invigorating. Given the conditions, bundling up in warm layers is advisable, combining hats, gloves, and insulated coats to combat the cold. While outdoor activities may be somewhat limited due to the chill and snow, a brisk walk along the beach could maintain a pleasant winter spirit, though care should be taken on untreated surfaces. This evening marks a typical late November scene and, being a few weeks from the winter solstice, it should remind residents of the season's character as the holidays approach.",
