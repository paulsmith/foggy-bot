    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the early morning hours are marked by a blanket of dense fog, creating a serene yet mysterious atmosphere. With temperatures nestled in the low 50s, the air feels damp and cool, wrapping around you with a lingering chill. As the night progresses into the day, the forecast predicts patchy fog continuing until sunrise, leading into a morning punctuated by gentle rain showers. Expect a high temperature reaching the mid-50s, accompanied by a shift to east winds that will pick up in intensity, bringing with them gusts that could reach 25 mph.\n\nThe prevailing weather presents a moody, somewhat drizzly day along the shores of Lake Michigan, where the waves might mirror the overcast skies, appearing slightly restless in the wind's push. Given these conditions, it's advisable to dress warmly, perhaps opting for a light jacket or a cozy sweater. The day calls for indoor activities or a stroll with an umbrella at hand, as the rain is anticipated to bring varying amounts throughout the morning. With Thanksgiving just days away, this weather serves as a reminder of the cozy gatherings and warm meals that define the season.",
