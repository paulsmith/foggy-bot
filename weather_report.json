    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the evening air carries a chill, as the temperature hovers in the mid-20s. The atmosphere is partly cloudy, offering a stark contrast to the previous bright days of summer. A blustery wind from the southeast adds a biting edge to the coolness, making it feel decidedly brisk. Given these conditions, the waves on Lake Michigan might display a lively rhythm, stirred by those gusts, making for a picturesque scene against the darkening sky.\n\nLooking ahead, the forecast for tomorrow indicates a shift in the weather, with rain likely to commence in the afternoon. As we transition from tonight's mostly cloudy skies to a dreary, overcast Saturday, temperatures are expected to climb slightly into the upper 30s. This heralds the first hints of winter's wet embrace, with a 60% chance of precipitation predicted, likely resulting in a light drizzle. For those venturing outside, layering will be essential to combat the cool, moist air. A warm coat, perhaps paired with a hat and gloves, strikes a sensible balance for outdoor activities while contemplating the changing seasons. Saturday will not present ideal conditions for recreational outings, but a cozy day indoors might be perfect for enjoying seasonal festivities as the holidays approach, with Christmas just around the corner.",
