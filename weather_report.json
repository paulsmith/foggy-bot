    "weather_report": "As the night deepens in Evanston, the conditions are defined by a cool and breezy atmosphere. The current temperature hovers around a brisk 40 degrees, accompanied by gusty winds from the west-northwest, reaching up to 25 mph, with occasional gusts that push even higher. The cloudy sky blankets the area, casting a subdued light over the beach and Lake Michigan, where the churning waters reflect the restless nature of the evening. The waves, while not tumultuous, are agitated enough to create a somber rhythm, reminiscent of the autumn season firmly settling in.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, residents can anticipate a sunny reprieve, with temperatures climbing to a modest 52 degrees. The winds will shift to a gentler north breeze, offering a more pleasant day for outdoor activities. Given the current chill, dressing in layers will be wise; a warm jacket paired with a hat will stave off the evening's bite, while during the day, lighter attire may suffice but a sweater or light coat could still be advisable for comfort.\n\nFor those considering how to spend this Halloween night, a quiet evening by the beach could invoke contemplation or a brisk walk along the shore, although the chill may lead many to stay indoors. However, with Halloween in full swing tomorrow, preparations for festivities might find a cozy spot in the hearts of those ready to embrace the seasonal spirit, perhaps with warm drinks and traditional gatherings.",
