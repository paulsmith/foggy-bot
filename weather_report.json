    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather presents a crisp and cool atmosphere, with temperatures in the low 20s and a light breeze. The day is mostly clear, but there is a forecast for some clouds rolling in tonight, and a slight chance of snow after 3 am. As you venture outside, you'll find the air invigorating, although the wind picks up at times, creating a brisk ambiance. The lake's waves are likely to be moderate, possibly adding to the frosty marine scenery along Lake Michigan.\n\nLooking ahead, expect sunny skies today with a daytime high approach the low 30s. In the evening, temperatures will dip slightly, so dressing warmly is advisable\u2014a layered outfit with a sturdy coat would suit the conditions well. As we are in February, these temperatures are typical for the season, marking it as a standard winter day in this region. Outdoor activities such as brisk walks, enjoying the beach view, or even gathering with friends for a warm drink are encouraged, but do be prepared for the chilly air as night descends.",
