    "weather_report": "As evening settles over Evanston, Illinois, the current scene is marked by a cool, damp atmosphere with temperatures hovering in the low 40s and a notable breeze sweeping in from the southwest. The air feels heavy and slightly clammy, creating an overall chill that might call for a warm jacket if venturing outdoors. The sky above is leaden, cloaked in clouds that suggest an impending shift to even more unsettled weather as the night progresses. \n\nLooking ahead, tonight promises increasing fog, with patchy drizzle expected to develop as the temperature dips to the mid-30s. Tomorrow's forecast brings lingering areas of fog in the early morning, giving way to brief moments of sunshine before midday. The high is anticipated to reach the lower 50s, accompanied by a gentle south wind. Given the season, these temperatures are typical for late November, but the wintry dampness may make it feel a touch cooler. \n\nThis weather makes for a rather uninviting outdoor experience, especially at the beach where rough waters may be present but not conducive to swimming or active beach outings. Instead, one might consider cozying up indoors or planning for light activities, such as a warm drink at a local caf\u00e9 or browsing nearby shops. With Thanksgiving just a day past, the spirit of the holiday lingers, inviting everyone to reflect and perhaps take a stroll to enjoy the waterfront before the festive hustle and bustle ramps up for the upcoming holiday season.",
