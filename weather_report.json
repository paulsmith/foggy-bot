    "weather_report": "The current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly atmosphere, with temperatures hovering in the low 20s and a blustery wind from the west, creating a piercing wind chill. The cloudy sky adds to the feeling of a winter evening as the visuals of the beach reflect the nighttime stillness. Tonight, expect it to remain partly cloudy, with temperatures dropping to the mid-teens, and wind chill potentially reaching a brisk zero degrees, showcasing the biting cold that defines this season.\n\nTomorrow\u2019s forecast promises sunnier skies but a chilly start, with daytime highs struggling to reach the mid-20s and a likelihood of feeling even colder due to that same persistent wind. As Evanston embraces another winter day, the beach scene may appear less appealing for outdoor activities, especially for those unaccustomed to such frigid conditions. Wave conditions are likely calm to moderate along Lake Michigan, but the fresh air and clear, sunny skies may invite a brief walk or some quiet reflection by the water. Dress warmly in layers, opting for a thick coat, gloves, and a hat to fend off the winter chill typical of late November in this region, where temperatures now align closely with seasonal norms.",
