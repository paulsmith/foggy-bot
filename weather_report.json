    "weather_report": "This morning in Evanston, the air is brisk and somewhat damp as temperatures hover in the low 40s, complemented by a blend of thick clouds hanging low in the sky. The strong, gusty winds are whispering off Lake Michigan, creating a chilly ambiance that may deter casual strolls along the water's edge. As we transition into Wednesday, expect similar cloud cover throughout the day with a high nearing the mid 50s. There may be a chance of rain developing after 5 PM, as southeast winds continue to blow steadily at around 15 mph, glancing up to 25 mph at times. \n\nMost outdoor activities may feel less than inviting, especially earlier in the day when the air is cool and the potential for rain looms. Attire is essential; a warm jacket paired with layers to fend off the chill will be necessary if venturing outside. While the conditions may not be ideal for a leisurely beach visit, they could actually be suited for an invigorating walk along the shore, provided one is prepared for the brisk wind and occasional spritz of rain. Overall, this day in November reflects typical seasonal behavior for the region, balancing the cool remnants of fall with the clouds of impending winter.",
