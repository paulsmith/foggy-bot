    "weather_report": "In Evanston, current conditions present a rather bleak outlook, with temperatures hovering in the mid 40s. The air feels damp and chilly, with a biting edge carried by a fierce wind whipping off Lake Michigan. Light rain is falling, mingling with thick fog, creating a heavy atmosphere that dampens visibility and lends itself to a rather dismal appearance across the beach. Expect the rain and patchy fog to linger throughout the afternoon, as the day warms only slightly before dipping back into the low 30s tonight. Although the wind is less intense than earlier, with gusts reaching around 30 mph, it still adds to an overall sense of chill that makes being outdoors less than inviting.\n\nWave conditions are likely to be moderately rough, with the wind creating some white caps along the lake, but not severe enough to preclude any adventurous souls who dare to step outside. As for attire, a warm, waterproof jacket, perhaps layered over a cozy sweater, along with sturdy footwear would be prudent when venturing out. This time of year typically sees temperatures in the low to mid 30s, so today's chill is not an unusual encounter for the season. Given the weather, it might be best to spend the day indoors, perhaps enjoying a warm drink or catching a movie, rather than facing the elements in the fading daylight.",
