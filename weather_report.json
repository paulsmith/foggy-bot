    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly scene with light snow falling, as temperatures hover in the low 20s, lending an icy touch to the landscape. The atmosphere is marked by a damp coolness, drawing upon the season\u2019s typical winter character. Today, one may expect a continuation of the snow with the possibility of flurries lingering into the afternoon. Clouds will dominate the sky, with a high reaching the upper 20s, while a brisk northeast wind stirs the air, sometimes feeling quite bold with gusts up to 25 mph. As temperatures subtly rise overnight, the chance of further light snow diminishes, giving way to a somewhat subdued evening.\n\nThe beach, though frosty, presents a visually appealing wintry scene that calls for warm attire. With the winds adding a bite to the cold, layering is essential: a sturdy winter coat, a cozy hat, and insulated footwear would ensure comfort during any outdoor ventures. The Lake Michigan waves may be tumultuous, so caution is recommended near the shoreline. As the snow gently blankets the ground, it offers a serene backdrop, perhaps encouraging a stroll along the waterfront or brief explorations in the parks, though enthusiasm for outdoor activities might be tempered by the chill. While today isn't marked by a holiday, the wintry conditions offer a quintessential Chicago winter experience, a moment to relish before the onset of spring.",
