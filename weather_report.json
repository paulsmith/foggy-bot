    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the air is charged with a chilly, dampness typical of late fall, with temperatures resting in the low 30s and a brisk westerly wind gathering strength, giving the surroundings a stark yet serene feel. Light snow is currently falling, painting a soft white over the landscape, while the darkness of night looms, dimming visibility along the shore of Lake Michigan. \n\nAs the evening deepens, scattered snow showers are expected to persist overnight, with temperatures dipping slightly into the upper 20s. The day ahead promises a switch between snow and rain by midday, likely accompanied by fierce gusts, making it feel quite tumultuous. New snow accumulation is anticipated, adding 1 to 3 inches to the already wintry scene. The churning waters of Lake Michigan may generate moderate waves, but their impact will be less pronounced given the current conditions and cooling temperatures. Dressing warmly in layers, perhaps with waterproof gear for the mix of snow and rain, will be essential for braving the elements. This time of year typically ushers in chill, but tonight\u2019s conditions strongly embody the seasonal transition into winter. With no major holiday on the horizon, the quietude of the night invites a contemplative stroll along the beach, though it may not be the most inviting weather for outdoor activities.",
