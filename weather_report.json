    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the morning brings a crisp, cool atmosphere with temperatures lingering in the mid-30s, complemented by a breezy west-northwest wind that adds a bite to the air. The skies are partly cloudy, with a grayish hue signaling a whisper of the day's lingering chill. Currently, there is no precipitation, providing a clear outlook for those venturing out early. As the day unfolds, expect conditions to remain mostly cloudy, with temperatures expected to hover around the mid-30s in the afternoon, gradually descending toward the low 30s tonight.\n\nThe day has a somewhat drab feel typical of early winter in the Midwest, characterized by the chill of Lake Michigan that can be felt in the air, though it allows for a peaceful serenity along the shore. To withstand the coolness and gusty winds, layered clothing is advisable\u2014think warm jackets, scarves, and perhaps a knit hat. As for activities, while outdoor adventures might be limited by the brisk conditions, a walk along the beach or a visit to a local caf\u00e9 could provide a cozy escape from the winter air. Today is simply a day like any other, with no significant holidays or events on the horizon, making it a normal, quiet Sunday in December.",
