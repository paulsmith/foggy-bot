    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the current weather presents a brisk scene with temperatures hovering in the low 30s, accompanied by a biting wind that sweeps across the beach, creating a distinctly chilly atmosphere. The sky is mostly cloudy, lending an overcast and muted tone to the day, while conditions are set to change significantly as the afternoon progresses. A chance of snow lingers, and as the day advances, snow is likely to make an appearance, possibly mixing with rain later in the evening.\n\nWith the wind howling from the south at a spirited pace, wave conditions along Lake Michigan may be choppy, inviting a sense of the wildness of winter. Although temperatures are a touch cooler than average for mid-December, they align with the seasonal expectations for this time of year in the Midwest. It's advisable to layer up for warmth, sporting sturdy outerwear, and perhaps a hat and gloves, especially for any outdoor endeavors. Given the forecast for precipitation and persistent cloud cover, indoor activities may be more pleasant, such as visiting local cafes or museums, allowing for a cozy reprieve from the wintry chill outside. As it's just a few weeks before the year's end and holiday festivities ramp up, staying warm will be paramount as you navigate the evolving weather.",
