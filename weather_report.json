    "weather_report": "Evanston's current weather is cool and damp, with temperatures in the low 50s and a blustery wind coming from the south, contributing to a brisk evening by the lakeshore. The sky is mostly cloudy, casting a shadow over the beach as night settles in, and while there's a slight chance of rain, it\u2019s more likely to remain dry as the winds whisper through the trees. Tonight\u2019s low will hover around 45 degrees, with a gentle breeze becoming more pronounced, especially along the shore where gusts may reach up to 25 miles per hour. \n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, expect more of the same\u2014mostly cloudy skies with a slight chance for sprinkles. Daytime highs are projected to near 60, though temperatures may drop slightly in the afternoon, making for a cool, but manageable day. The waves on Lake Michigan are likely to be choppy, perfect for watching from a distance rather than venturing into the water. In terms of attire, layering is advised; a light jacket or sweater will keep you comfortable, and perhaps a waterproof layer just in case those rain showers arrive. Given that we\u2019re well into fall, these temperatures feel quite typical for this season, making for a tranquil weekend by the lake. Engaging in an evening stroll along the beach or basking in the tranquility of the park would be delightful choices, although beach trips may be less inviting under the cloud cover.",
