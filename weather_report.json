    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston paint a chilly, overcast picture with temperatures nestled in the mid-30s and a brisk breeze whispering from the west. The atmosphere feels damp and cool, giving one a taste of a typical wintry night in the Midwest, with dark clouds hanging heavy above, suggesting impending precipitation. The beach view reveals still waters of Lake Michigan, likely to rise in agitation as expected snow will begin to sprinkle down after midnight, with accumulation estimated to be minimal.\n\nAs we look toward the weather forecast, the probabilities of snow linger in the night air, ushering in a slight chance of flurries on Wednesday morning. Daytime will bring a mix of partly sunny skies but will remain on the cool side, with afternoon temperatures dipping to the low 30s. The winds are expected to shift, providing a gusty chill likely to be felt more with the wind chill factor. Attire should be layered for warmth, with comfy winter coats, gloves, and scarves to fend off the cool air while lazing by the lake or enjoying wintry activities. For those seeking to embrace the season, a stroll along the shoreline might be inviting, albeit bundled up, to appreciate the serene beauty of a winter evening. Notably, this is not a holiday weekend, but the festive spirit of the season adds a layer of cheer as the year draws to a close.",
