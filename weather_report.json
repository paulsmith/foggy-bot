    "weather_report": "Evanston is experiencing a brisk and cloudy morning with temperatures hovering in the low 40s, accompanied by a blustery northwestern wind that adds a chill to the air. The lack of direct sunlight casts a gray tone over the landscape, creating a somewhat muted atmosphere typical of late November. As the day progresses, residents can expect persistent cloud cover, with temperatures peaking around 45 before gradually dipping again. While there may be patchy drizzle before midnight, it should remain mostly dry throughout the daytime hours. \n\nThe significant winds create sizable waves on Lake Michigan, making it a less-than-ideal day for beachside activities. It\u2019s a good idea to layer up, opting for warm jackets, scarves, and hats to combat the cool conditions. As we approach Thanksgiving, this chilly weather aligns well with the season, encouraging warmth within homes and gatherings. The overall ambiance may suit those who appreciate a cozy indoor setting with friends and family. Therefore, consider planning indoor activities or holiday preparations as we navigate this crisp late autumn day.",
