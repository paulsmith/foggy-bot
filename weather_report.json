The humidity lingers gently in the atmosphere, making it feel pleasant enough for a stroll, even as strong gusts whip through, lending a bright, lively quality to the mostly clear skies.

With no precipitation forecast for the rest of the day, outdoor plans should be secure. However, as the forecast suggests cooler temperatures tonight\u2014dropping to the low 40s\u2014dressing in layers would be wise, combining comfortable attire with a light jacket to ward off the evening chill. Overall, this weather reflects typical seasonal trends for mid-November in the Midwest, making it a delightful time to appreciate the beauty of nature before winter's firm grasp takes hold.",
