    "weather_report": "The current conditions in Evanston are quite brisk, with temperatures lingering in the low single digits, creating a biting chill that makes outdoor activities feel even colder. The day opens under a blanket of cloud cover, and with a fierce wind from the northwest at a considerable pace, it adds to the sense of chill, driving wind chill values down to a frosty -10. As we look ahead, overnight temperatures are expected to dip slightly below freezing, with a predicted low of around 4. On Wednesday, residents can anticipate intermittent snow showers in the afternoon, amid cloudy skies and temperatures climbing to the mid-teens. Despite the moderate chance of precipitation at 20%, the primary feature of the day will be the cold and overcast conditions that dominate the landscape.\n\nFor those keen on venturing outside, it\u2019s essential to dress warmly, donning layers with heavy winter coats, hats, and gloves to shield against the biting cold. Wave conditions along Lake Michigan will likely be choppy, reflecting the gusty winds and cooler air, which may not be ideal for activities near the water. While the weather is certainly challenging, this particular late winter day provides an opportunity to embrace the season's chill and perhaps enjoy indoor pursuits, such as visiting a local caf\u00e9 or partaking in community events. As for the calendar, today is a regular Tuesday in February, as the anticipation builds for the approaching spring.",
