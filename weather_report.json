    "weather_report": "As night falls over Evanston, current conditions reflect a chilly atmosphere with temperatures hovering in the upper 40s. The air feels cool and damp, complemented by a gusty breeze that stirs the evening air, making for quite a brisk outing. The clouds blanket the sky, hinting at possible rain later tonight, but nothing is falling just yet. With a slight chance of showers post-11 PM, the forecast urges vigilance, as temperatures are expected to dip down to the mid-40s.\n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, the day promises more of the same cloudiness, with a slight chance of rain showers lingering throughout. Expect highs in the upper 50s, gradually cooling down as the afternoon progresses. Conditions will remain breezy, with winds from the southwest adding an extra chill to the air. This time of year in Evanston, temperatures typical for mid-November are hovering right around the mark, so dress warmly if venturing outdoors. A layered approach with a warm coat is advisable, perhaps complemented by a light scarf. Given the weather, indoor activities may be more appealing\u2014consider visiting a museum or enjoying a cozy caf\u00e9 rather than facing the uncertain elements.",
