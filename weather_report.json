    "weather_report": "Current weather conditions in Evanston, Illinois, reveal a somewhat bleak atmosphere, with light rain drizzling from the sky. The temperature rests in the low 50s, creating a damp and chilly environment alongside a blustery wind that sweeps off Lake Michigan. As the night deepens, precipitation is expected to continue with rain showers and patchy drizzle lingering until the early hours. \n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, the weather appears to be on the mend, transitioning to a partly sunny disposition with a high approaching the low 60s, though temperatures will fall to the mid-50s by the afternoon as a gusty southwest wind stirs through the area. While wave activity on the lake isn't particularly favorable for recreational boating this evening due to rough conditions, tomorrow holds more promise for outdoor activities, provided one stays vigilant against the chance of lingering drizzle in the morning. Given the dampness, it's advisable to don waterproof attire and pack a light layer, as the air will feel crisp and invigorating. Overall, the current conditions mark a typical November evening in the region, bidding farewell to the warmth of summer and ushering in the cool embrace of autumn. A walk along the beach may be refreshing, though a cozy indoor activity could prove more appealing until the rain clears.",
