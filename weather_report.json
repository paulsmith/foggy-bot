    "weather_report": "The current conditions in Evanston paint a typical winter evening, with temperatures lingering in the low 40s, accompanied by light rain and a veil of fog that softens the landscape. The air feels damp and cool, with a brisk wind whispering from the south, creating a chilly atmosphere that hints at more precipitation to come. Tonight, expect a continued likelihood of rain, particularly before 9 PM, followed by a patchy fog that may linger into the early hours. The mercury will dip to around the upper 30s, indicating that residents should brace for a nighttime chill.\n\nAs we look ahead to Friday, the scene will remain rather dreary. Roll in the morning with showers and the possibility of thunderstorms before 9 AM, leading to an overcast day, with temperatures peaking in the high 30s before falling back into the mid-30s later in the afternoon. The winds will pick up, blowing from the northeast with a touch of vigor, potentially gusting up to 30 mph, which adds to the rawness of the day. The beach, often a gathering point for sun-worshippers in warmer months, will not be inviting in this weather. Instead, it will likely be met with choppy waters and overcast skies. As such, a warm coat, perhaps layered with gloves and a hat, will be essential for any outdoor ventures. Given the time of year and current conditions, this weather reflects the typical chill of late January in the Midwest, with temperatures that are comfortably cool yet damp enough to keep most inside. Engaging in indoor activities is a better choice for the day ahead, with a preference for cozy spaces over braving the unfriendly outdoors.",
