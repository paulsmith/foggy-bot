    "weather_report": "As midnight approaches in Evanston, the scene is marked by a gentle but persistent chill, with temperatures dipping into the low 40s. The air is pleasantly cool, thanks to a humidity level that adds a crisp edge to the evening ambiance, making it feel refreshing. Currently, the sky is mostly clear, allowing a few stars to twinkle above, while a south-southeast breeze whispers through the area. Tomorrow promises to maintain this cool character, with a high in the low 50s. However, clouds will dominate the skyline, and a light, shifting wind may pick up, creating a blustery atmosphere at times. \n\nThe outlook for precipitation is clear, maintaining the dry spell, though tomorrow\u2019s forecast aligns with the seasonal transition into more typical late autumn weather \u2014 ideal for bundling up and enjoying the outdoors. As for attire, layering is recommended; a warm jacket and cozy hat will keep you comfortable against the evening chill, while a brisk walk along the beach or a visit to local parks could be invigorating activities. Though the waters of Lake Michigan may be somewhat restless, the beach remains a serene spot, awaiting the rush of a new day.",
