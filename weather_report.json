    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the night settles in with a cool, slightly damp breeze. As the current conditions show, the temperature hovers in the upper 40s, presenting a crispness that invites a light jacket. With the air feeling somewhat thick, one might find the atmosphere a bit muggy, despite the cloud cover casting a muted veil over the surroundings. The south winds, blowing steadily at a brisk pace, add a gusty chill, stirring up the peacefulness of this lakeside community.\n\nLooking ahead to the day, expect mostly cloudy skies to prevail, interspersed with a slight chance of rain showers. The temperature is set to rise into the upper 50s, allowing for a moderately comfortable atmosphere, although a drop to the mid-50s in the afternoon could make it feel a little cooler. While the chance of rain remains low, any outdoor activity should be prefaced by preparations for possible drizzle. Wave conditions along Lake Michigan are expected to be gentle, suitable for a tranquil stroll by the water, while the low light may encourage cozy indoor pursuits as the day unfolds. So bundle up in layers\u2014especially with a sweater or light coat\u2014and enjoy the evening atmosphere without forgetting your umbrella just in case.",
