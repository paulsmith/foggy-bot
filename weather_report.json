    "weather_report": "As night settles over Evanston, the temperature hovers in the low 20s, offering a crisp and cool ambiance that feels invigorating yet bracing. With the air relatively dry, the evening's clear skies allow for a tranquil view, perfect for those who appreciate a quiet shoreline. Winds are blustery coming from the west northwest, creating a slightly chilly sensation, particularly near the water's edge. The beach is calm, presenting manageable wave conditions ideal for outdoor spectators, though boating activities are likely not advisable at this hour.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, expect partly sunny skies with a slight chance of snow showers. Daytime highs will reach into the upper 20s, paired with a gentle breeze that should provide a somewhat comfortable experience for those venturing outdoors. Attire suitable for the conditions would include warm layers\u2014perhaps a heavy coat, gloves, and a hat\u2014as temperatures reflect the winter season typical for this region. While the chill may deter some, the clear expanse of Lake Michigan, contrasting with the muted hues of the shoreline, offers a serene backdrop for a brisk walk or a moment of reflection, particularly as we move toward the festive season.",
