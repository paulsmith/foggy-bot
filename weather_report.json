    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reflect a crisp and cool evening, with a temperature hovering in the low 20s. The air carries a gentle breeze from the west-northwest, adding a fresh bite typical of early December. Tonight\u2019s skies are mostly cloudy, and with temperatures expected to drop near 19, it's a night best enjoyed wrapped in a warm coat, perhaps layered beneath a sweater, complemented by a cozy scarf and gloves to fend off the chill.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, there\u2019s a slight chance of snow showers, so if venturing outdoors, it\u2019s wise to dress for the possibility of flurries. Temperatures will rise to the upper 20s, but the light winds will continue to lend a brisk feel to the day. The lake is likely to have some gentle waves as the winds stir the waters of Lake Michigan, perfect for a quiet stroll along the shore, although one should prepare for the uncertainty of any icy patches that might linger. As we remain deep in winter, these conditions are typical for this time of year, making for a scene that captures the essence of a Midwestern December evening.",
