    "weather_report": "Evanston is experiencing raw and blustery conditions this evening, with temperatures hovering in the low 50s accompanied by a persistent, dreary drizzle. The air feels damp and chilly as light rain continues to fall, creating a gray, overcast sky that muffles the shoreline's usual vibrance. Winds are quite gusty, whipping through at speeds that add a sharp, biting edge to the atmosphere, especially near the lake front.\n\nAs night envelops the area, scattered showers are expected to persist, tapering off to patchy fog and light drizzle into the early hours. Tomorrow, the forecast brings more rain and fog, with highs reaching only the mid-40s as nighttime chill sets back in. Given these uninspiring conditions, it would be wise to dress warmly in layers, opting for waterproof outerwear and sturdy shoes if you plan to venture outdoors. The choppy waves of Lake Michigan may also present tricky conditions, discouraging swimming or boating activities. Overall, it\u2019s a day better suited for cozy indoor pursuits, like visiting a local caf\u00e9 or having a warm meal while the weather churns outside, with no significant holidays or events on the horizon to spur outdoor gatherings.",
