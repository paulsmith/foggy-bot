    "weather_report": "This evening in Evanston brings cool and slightly damp air as temperatures linger in the low 50s, creating a crisp, yet pleasant atmosphere. A gentle, shifting breeze dances from the west-northwest, with occasional gusts that lend a lively touch to the night. With mostly clear skies, the scene along the shore is bathed in a serene calmness, making for an inviting evening for those who appreciate the sound of the waves lapping against the beach.\n\nAs we approach the overnight hours, expect warmth in the forecast, with temperatures subtly rising to around the mid 40s as the night unfolds. Tomorrow, a chance of rain will introduce more clouds, particularly before noon, followed by scattered showers through the afternoon. Highs will likely hover near the upper 40s, with a more pronounced breeze and potential gusts that could stir up the waves along Lake Michigan. Given the coolness and upcoming rain, it's advisable to bundle up in layers and bring an umbrella if venturing outdoors. The current conditions, while ideal for a stroll, will soon transition to spattering showers, steering weekend activities indoors or to sheltered spots along the shoreline. Overall, while we are not in the midst of a major holiday today, Thanksgiving looms on the horizon, inviting preparations and gratitude in the community.",
