    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois reveal a brisk evening as temperatures settle in the low 50s. The air carries a hint of humidity, making it feel slightly damp. With a vigorous breeze sweeping in from the northeast, the atmosphere is brisk and somewhat invigorating. Tonight\u2019s skies remain partly cloudy, offering a modest glimpse of the stars while the capricious winds rustle through the trees.\n\nAs we look toward tomorrow\u2019s forecast, expect a partly sunny day with temperatures rising into the upper 50s. A gentle southeast wind will shift toward a more blustery pace in the afternoon, reaching gusts that could stir the lake's surface. Fortunately, no precipitation is expected, promising a clear and pleasant day for outdoor activities. Given the season, these temperatures feel somewhat typical for November in the Midwest. For appropriate attire, consider layering with a light jacket and perhaps a scarf to guard against the chill. The weather invites a leisurely stroll along the beach, a visit to local shops, or simply enjoying the scenery at one of Evanston's parks before winter fully sets in.",
