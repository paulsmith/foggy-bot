    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently experiencing a chilly day with temperatures hovering in the low 40s, wrapped in a blanket of clouds that dimmed the morning light. The brisk northwest winds are quite vigorous, gusting at times, adding a notable edge to the coolness in the air. This creates a somewhat raw sensation for those venturing outdoors. Today\u2019s weather will see these clouds persist, with a slight rise in temperature to the mid 40s, before cooling off again this afternoon. Expect a further drop as the evening unfolds, settling around the upper 30s.\n\nWith waves likely churning along Lake Michigan due to the strong winds, the beach today may not be ideal for leisurely strolls or sunbathing, although it could still intrigue those who appreciate the power of nature in its full, blustery glory. There is no precipitation forecasted, so expect the skies to remain cloudy without any rain on the horizon. To combat the wind\u2019s bite, wearing layered clothing would be wise; a warm jacket along with a hat and gloves would ensure comfort while outside. This time of year, temperatures in the low 40s feel quite typical for late November in the Midwest, making it a good day for indoor activities or a brisk walk if properly layered. Given that today is the day before Thanksgiving, it might be a good time to finalize preparations for the festivities ahead.",
