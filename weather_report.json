    "weather_report": "This morning in Evanston, the air feels crisp and cool as temperatures hover in the mid-20s, accompanied by a gentle wind from the southwest that adds a refreshing touch to the atmosphere. Currently, the sky is mostly cloudy, setting a somewhat muted tone, but those clouds will slowly break apart as the day progresses. By the afternoon, expect a high nearing the mid-40s with a light to moderate breeze that could stir up some rolling waves along the shoreline. \n\nFor today's adventures, dressing in layers would be wise; consider a warm jacket with a cozy sweater underneath. While the absence of precipitation keeps things dry and manageable, evenings will bring a gentle chill with temperatures dropping into the upper 30s. Despite the transitional weather typical for early December in the Midwest, it\u2019s a fine day for a brisk walk by the beach or perhaps enjoying the views of Lake Michigan while wrapped up in warm attire. As a reminder, we\u2019re just a week away from celebrating the holiday season, which adds a touch of festivity to the fall atmosphere.",
