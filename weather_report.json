    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather presents a chilly and somewhat damp scene, with temperatures hovering in the mid-20s and a gentle breeze whispering from the west-southwest. As the day unfolds, residents can expect an increase in cloud cover and a chance of snow during the afternoon hours, transitioning to a mix of rain and snow later, with temperatures peaking near the low 30s. The impending snow may result in a light dusting, with less than half an inch expected.\n\nThe murky sky and overcast conditions lend a bleak appearance to the beach, where Lake Michigan's waves are gently rippling against the shoreline. With precipitation likely and gusty winds reaching up to 15 mph, it would be prudent to dress warmly, layering up with a good coat, gloves, and perhaps a scarf to combat the chill. Despite it being the holiday season, today is not marked by any significant celebration, but the weather conditions may limit outdoor activities to brief jaunts rather than extended outings. Given the current season, these temperatures are typical for December in the Midwest, presenting a quintessential winter\u2019s day.",
