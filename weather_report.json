    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the night is settling in with a crisp chill as temperatures linger in the upper 20s, giving off a distinctly frosty air. The winds are gusty, whipping through at nearly 25 miles per hour from the southwest, adding a piercing bite to the clear skies. The overall ambiance is punctuated by the serene view of Lake Michigan, though the cool breeze may discourage long outdoor stays without adequate layers. As we look ahead, the night will bring cloud cover, with temperatures dipping slightly further to a low around 26. \n\nTomorrow's forecast suggests a mostly cloudy day with a high in the low 40s. The winds will continue to be fairly brisk at 10 to 20 miles per hour, possibly gusting even higher, which may stir the lake\u2019s waters, creating lively waves ideal for distant viewing but likely not suitable for swimming. Overall, dress warmly if venturing outside, ideally layering up to ward off the chill, perfect for enjoying a brisk walk along the shoreline or partaking in holiday preparations indoors. In light of the season, these temperatures are typical for early December, as the community gears up for festive celebrations in the weeks to come.",
