    "weather_report": "The current conditions in Evanston reveal a quiet beachside scene, marked by cloudy skies that wrap the night in muted tones. With a temperature resting at a comfortable 67 degrees, a brisk wind from the south-southwest is stirring, bringing gusts that may challenge the warmth outside. Tonight offers little in the way of precipitation, though the winds may leave a hint of chill in the air. As dawn approaches, Wednesday promises a shift to partly sunny skies, allowing the sun to break through and elevate the daytime high to a pleasant 78 degrees before temperatures dip slightly in the afternoon.\n\nThe waves of Lake Michigan, though likely creating some froth under this wind, appear calm for now, reflecting a tranquil environment perfect for an evening stroll. For those venturing out, light layers would suffice, perhaps a comfortable cardigan or light jacket to counter the wind. Seasonal for late October, the weather invites locals to enjoy a leisurely afternoon at the park or a casual bike ride along the lakefront, embracing the tranquility before the full force of autumn sets in.",
