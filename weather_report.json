    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Evanston, the air carries a cool snap, with current temperatures resting in the upper 40s. The atmosphere is slightly overcast, with clouds thickening in the sky, hinting at the drizzle that may accompany the morning hours. A brisk wind from the north northwest adds a blustery chill, stirring the beach and Lake Michigan into gentle, rippling waves. While today isn't expected to bring significant rainfall, there's a chance of light drizzle, creating a muted backdrop for the day.\n\nLooking ahead, the forecast suggests that temperatures will reach a high in the low 50s, with a gradual drop in the afternoon. Expect a predominantly cloudy sky, making it feel a touch dreary as the potential for more consistent precipitation looms in the forecasts for later. This weather, reflective of late November in the Midwest, invites cozy layers\u2014light jackets and perhaps a scarf for those venturing outside. Given the light chances of rain and the cool breezes, outdoor activities might be best reserved for quick strolls along the beach rather than extended periods of play or relaxation. With Thanksgiving weekend winding down, families might consider wrapping up gatherings, making the most of the day before the holiday season truly begins.",
