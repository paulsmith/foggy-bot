    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois, reveal a frigid winter scene, with temperatures hovering in the low teens and a brisk northwesterly wind adding a biting edge to the air. The day is mostly shrouded in clouds, casting a dull light over the landscape, and it's an overall uncomfortable chill, with wind chill values plummeting to dangerous depths. As we look ahead, the forecast for tonight indicates a continuation of mostly cloudy skies, with temperatures expected to dip to around 3 degrees, pushing those wind chill figures even lower.\n\nAs Wednesday unfolds, expect intermittent snow showers by the afternoon, which will likely add a layer of white to the already bleak setting. The high temperature will struggle to reach the mid-teens, presenting a harsh reminder of winter\u2019s grasp on the area. With wave conditions likely to be choppy due to the blustery winds, outdoor enthusiasts should be cautious. Recommended attire includes heavy winter coats, insulated layers, hats, and scarves to combat the cold. While the chill might deter extensive outdoor activities, it's a perfect time for indoor pursuits or perhaps a brief venture outside to experience the winter wonderland\u2014always a unique sight by the lakeshore this season.",
