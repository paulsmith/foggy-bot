    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently shrouded in a thick cloak of fog, with temperatures lingering in the low 40s, complemented by a blustery wind that stirs the cool air and adds an invigorating chill to the atmosphere. The reduced visibility paints a rather moody scene, making outdoor activities less appealing at this moment. As the afternoon progresses, expect cloudy skies to give way to patchy fog, particularly as the day wanes. Tonight, a slight chance of rain will drift in, with temperatures holding steady and potentially rising slightly overnight, creating an atmosphere that feels damp and chilly.\n\nThe combination of the cool air and nearly saturated conditions renders it uncomfortably damp, so if venturing outside is necessary, layering up with warm clothing is advisable\u2014think jackets and perhaps a hat to keep the dampness at bay. Wave conditions along the shore are likely to be moderate but could become more turbulent later with the wind gusts expected this evening. Although there's no major holiday on this date, it may be prudent to plan indoor activities that match the chilly, grey mood of the day, like visiting local establishments or cozying up with a good book while listening to the soothing sounds of nature outside.",
