    "weather_report": "As night settles in Evanston, the current conditions present a crisp atmosphere, with temperatures hovering in the upper 40s and a gentle dampness in the air. The wind is stirring along the shoreline from the west, creating a breezy yet refreshing environment. The beach, illuminated by the soft glow of lights, reveals no signs of precipitation tonight, promising clear skies ahead. Looking toward Friday, we can expect a bright, sunny day with temperatures peaking in the upper 50s; but as the afternoon rolls in, the mercury will gradually slide to a more comfortable mid-50s. \n\nIn terms of attire, a light jacket or sweater will serve well against the cool breeze, especially as evening descends and temperatures dip to the low 40s. Given the lack of rain and sunshine on the horizon, outdoor activities such as a leisurely stroll along the beach or visiting nearby parks would be ideal. It\u2019s a fitting backdrop for enjoying the unfolding beauty of late fall, typical for this region at this time of year. Overall, the weather is shaping up to be pleasant for a late autumn evening.",
