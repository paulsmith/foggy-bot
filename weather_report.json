    "weather_report": "Today in Evanston, it's a chilly morning greeted by light snow and a whistling northwest wind, creating a brisk atmosphere. The current conditions hover in the low 30s, which is typical for this time of year as we embrace the depths of late November. As the day progresses, expect the weather to take on a more hectic character, with snow giving way to a mix of rain and snow, as the high temperature climbs toward the low 40s. Gusty winds will whip through the area, reaching upwards of 50 mph, particularly fierce near the lakefront, which may stir up choppy waves on Lake Michigan.\n\nWhile the snowy scene might strike a pleasant note for some, the blend of moisture and cool temperatures combines to produce a rather raw outdoor experience, so dressing warmly with layers is essential. Expect periods of precipitation, with accumulations potentially reaching 2 to 4 inches by day's end, creating slick conditions on the roads and sidewalks. Consider staying indoors and warming up with a hot drink while perhaps catching up with friends or family, as outdoor activities may be better suited for another day. Since today doesn't fall on a particular holiday, it\u2019s a regular Tuesday, but given the wintery weather, it\u2019s a perfect opportunity to cozy up indoors with a book or a movie as the colder months firmly establish themselves.",
