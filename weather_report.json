    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston present a chilly scene, with temperatures in the mid-30s amid light rain and a shroud of fog. The air feels quite damp, making for a perceptibly cold atmosphere, while fierce winds whip along the shoreline, producing waves that may be restless but manageable for seasoned beachgoers. Expect dark clouds to linger as rain falls, tapering slightly tonight with a low hovering around 40 degrees.\n\nAs we look ahead, today\u2019s weather is set to include more rain, particularly in the afternoon, accompanied by a high in the low 40s. The gusty winds will continue, so outdoor activities should be approached with care. For those venturing out, dressing warmly in layers, with a waterproof jacket and sturdy footwear, will be essential to combat the bluster and moisture. Given that it\u2019s the day before Thanksgiving, many will be bustling about in preparation for the holiday. While outdoor enjoyment may be limited, cozy indoor activities or visiting local shops could provide some solace from the relentless weather.",
