Despite the cold, the air feels crisp and clear, ideal for those bundled up against the elements. As we move into the overnight hours, expect partly cloudy skies and a low near ten, with wind chill values potentially dipping into the negatives\u2014a reminder that winter is in full swing. Tomorrow brings a promise of partly sunny weather, with temperatures climbing to near 30 in the afternoon. \n\nAlthough wave conditions may be moderate along the shores of Lake Michigan, the absence of precipitation allows for a serene waterfront view, albeit capped by chilly air. Recommended attire for the day calls for heavy winter clothing\u2014think warm layers, a sturdy coat, gloves, and perhaps even a scarf, as the combination of temperatures and wind may lead to a biting chill. With the season firmly in winter's grasp, these temperatures are typical for the region, perhaps even leaning toward the chilly side for mid-December. While outdoor activities might seem limited tonight, the brisk weather could entice adventurous spirits to engage in winter walks, especially with a cozy holiday spirit in the air as we approach the Christmas season.",
