    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather paints a chilly scene both at the beach and throughout the area. The temperature lingers in the low 40s, accompanied by a brisk wind stirring from the west-northwest, almost howling at times, which contributes to a rather biting feel in the air. The skies are mostly clear, giving way to a crisp night that frames the city in a serene darkness. Looking ahead, the forecast promises a slightly warmer overnight, with temperatures rising to the mid-30s before climbing even closer to the 40s by daybreak. \n\nTomorrow brings sunny skies, with daytime highs expected near the low 40s and temperatures steadily dropping to around the upper 30s by afternoon, all while a moderate wind continues to play a significant role in how it feels outside. This weather aligns with typical winter conditions for the region, making it a day for warm attire. Layering up is advisable\u2014think heavy coats and perhaps a cozy scarf, especially if you're planning to venture outdoors. The wave conditions along Lake Michigan could be quite active, influenced by that gusty wind. Given the clear skies and dry weather, tomorrow is likely a good opportunity for outdoor activities like brisk walks along the beach or enjoying the fresh winter air. There are no forthcoming holidays this week, but it's a charming winter day to embrace in central Evanston.",
