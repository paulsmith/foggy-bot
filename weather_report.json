    "weather_report": "As we look out over Evanston today, conditions are distinctly chilly, with temps hovering in the mid-teens and a noticeable briskness whipping through the air. The sky is layered with clouds, setting a somber tone, while wind gusts add a bit of bite to the atmosphere. This afternoon, a few intermittent snow showers are expected, making for a rather dreary scene, and temperatures will dip slightly, touching around 14 by the end of the day, with wind chill values plunging as low as zero.\n\nTonight holds more promise for snow, with the temperature dropping to a frigid low in the single digits and wind chill potentially taking it down to a biting -9. Conditions will remain overcast, and with a 30% chance of snow showers, it\u2019s likely that the landscape will be transformed into a wintry canvas. Now, while the shore of Lake Michigan may host some gentle waves, the cold will discourage any outdoor activities. Those venturing out should bundle up in warm layers, with insulated coats, hats, and gloves, to combat the cold. In the context of the season, these temperatures are consistent with what one would expect for February in this part of the Midwest, making it a true winter\u2019s day.",
