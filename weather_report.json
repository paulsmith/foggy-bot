    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a crisp and cool ambiance as temperatures linger in the low 40s. The air carries a noticeable humidity that adds to the chill, while a blustery southeast wind stirs the atmosphere, creating a refreshing, if slightly brisk, feel. As night settles, the skies are primarily obscured by clouds, offering a mostly cloudy view, perfect for those who enjoy a tranquil evening by the lake.\n\nLooking ahead, residents can expect mostly cloudy skies continuing through the night, with temperatures dipping down to around the low 40s. Tomorrow, anticipate a chance of rain after 5 PM, with temperatures climbing just into the mid-50s. The southeast winds will persist, bringing gusts that might turn the beach into a sight of rolling waves. Given tonight's conditions, the beach may not be ideal for outings; however, should you venture out, layering up with a warm jacket and a hat would be wise. It\u2019s an average November scene for the area\u2014temperatures align well with typical seasonal expectations and highlight the transition into winter. As it\u2019s a Tuesday and without any major holiday in sight, you might find the beach pleasantly quiet for a reflective stroll along the shore or a peaceful evening of contemplation.",
