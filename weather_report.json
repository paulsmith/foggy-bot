    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston offer a brisk and biting chill, with temperatures resting in the mid-teens and a clear expanse above. Winds are gusty, whipping in from the west-northwest, adding a fierce edge to the evening air that feels even colder when combined with the wind chill. Overnight, expect primarily clear skies giving way to a low near freezing, though it will feel much colder, with temperatures only slightly rising as morning approaches.\n\nLooking ahead to Washington's Birthday, the forecast hints at a partly sunny day with a high creeping near the low teens, but again, the cold will make its presence felt with wind chills dipping as low as -14 degrees. Wave conditions along Lake Michigan could be slightly choppy in these blustery conditions, so keep an eye on the shoreline if venturing out. Given the frigid atmosphere, dress warmly in layers, choosing insulated outerwear and hats to guard against the penetrating cold. As winter envelops the Midwest, today\u2019s temperatures align with the expected chill of this season, setting a fitting backdrop for indoor activities. With no special holidays on the horizon, a cozy day spent at home, perhaps by the fireside, could be ideal as the weather remains truly unforgiving.",
