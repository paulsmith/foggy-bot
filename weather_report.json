    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the morning presents a chilly and overcast scene, with current temperatures hovering in the low 30s. The air feels brisk, as the mix of cold temperatures and a touch of moisture adds a bite to the atmosphere. Today's forecast hints at a possibility of snow and freezing drizzle at intervals throughout the day, leading to a high near the mid-30s. The weather will remain cloudy, accompanied by a gentle east-northeast breeze that may stir the air, bringing a slight chill to anyone venturing outside.\n\nWave conditions along the lakeshore are likely to be moderate, with the churning waters reflecting the day's chilliness. Anyone looking to enjoy outdoor activities should dress warmly in layers, as temperatures will dip to around the low 20s tonight. Given that today is an ordinary day without any significant holidays or events, it may be best to plan indoor activities, perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9 or a day of reading by the fire, as the forecast suggests a mix of precipitation could make the outdoors less inviting.",
