    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current weather paints a stark picture of winter's chill, with temperatures hovering in the mid-teens and blustery winds creating a biting environment. The air feels notably sharp, accentuated by the wind, which whips through the area at fierce speeds, imposing a wind chill that can plunge to -5 degrees. The sky is partly cloudy, presenting a somewhat stark yet intriguing view of the night. \n\nLooking ahead, the forecast suggests a continuation of winter weather as occasional snow and scattered snow showers are expected overnight, giving way to a mostly sunny day tomorrow with a slight warming trend peaking near the upper 20s. Given these conditions, the appearance outdoors is undeniably unpleasant, with low visibility expected due to snow and the relentless gusts adding a layer of discomfort. The lake may show some wave action, particularly as the winds remain howling through the night and into the next day. \n\nConsidering the frigid temperature and impending snow, dressing warmly is crucial; sturdy winter gear, including insulated coats, hats, and gloves will be necessary to stay comfortable. As we find ourselves in the throes of December, these conditions are typical for the Midwest, where winter has firmly settled in. Outdoor activities, however, may be limited; a cozy evening indoors or engaging in winter sports, like snowshoeing, could be more enjoyable as the cold persists. Remember, this time of year calls for caution and preparation as we embrace the full force of winter.",
