    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current conditions present a rather humid and cloudy afternoon, with temperatures comfortably in the upper 60s. The breeze is brisk, providing a fresh, invigorating touch against the backdrop of Lake Michigan. With rain on the horizon, it seems the day will shift towards more unsettled weather, as forecasters predict cloud cover to deepen with a chance of rain arriving before evening. This chance intensifies into a likely scenario tonight, accompanied by possible thunderstorms and a drop in temperatures to the low 60s.\n\nSuch atmospheric conditions give the beach scene a muted, yet serene quality, but one may find the waters somewhat choppy as waves gather energy from the gusty winds. Precipitation amounts could reach three-quarters of an inch, which may make outdoor plans less appealing. Ideal attire would lean towards layers, with a light jacket being recommended to ward off the cool breeze, particularly as evening approaches. Given the current season, these temperatures are typical for early November in the Midwest, signaling the gradual shift into winter. As the clouds roll in and rain threatens, indoor activities may be best\u2014consider visiting local cafes or museums to escape the elements while still enjoying the charm of Evanston during this transitional season.",
