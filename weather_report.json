    "weather_report": "This evening in Evanston, current conditions are marked by a biting chill with light snow falling, as temperatures hover in the upper 20s. The air carries a brisk wind that sweeps in from the west-northwest, creating a sharp contrast against the wintry scene. As night sets in, the chance of additional snow remains until 9 PM, with cloudy skies dominating the backdrop, offering a rather muted and overcast appearance outside.\n\nLooking ahead, Friday promises slightly clearer conditions, bathed in mostly sunny skies but with a high in the mid-20s. The breeze will continue to whistle at a noticeable pace, keeping the air feeling icy. Given these weather conditions, bundling up in heavy layers with a warm hat and gloves is advisable to combat the penetrating cold. Approximately typical for mid-winter in this region, today\u2019s temperatures reflect what one would expect during this seasonal turn. While outdoor activities may be limited due to the cold and snow, a brisk walk along the frozen shore of Lake Michigan could be invigorating for those who are well-prepared, capturing the essence of winter's stark beauty\u2014though caution should be exercised on slippery surfaces.",
