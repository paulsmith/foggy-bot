    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston, Illinois present a brisk and chilly afternoon, with temperatures hovering in the low 30s and a blustery wind sweeping from the southwest, making it feel even colder. The sky is mostly cloudy, offering only a hint of sunshine, which may struggle to break through the thick cloud cover. Looking ahead, the weather will remain mostly cloudy into the evening, with temperatures dipping to around 25 degrees and a strengthening breeze that could gust up to 35 mph. \n\nThe open waters of Lake Michigan display gentle waves, though the wind may give rise to a bit of chop along the shore. There is no significant precipitation in sight, allowing for a clearer view across the lake, though the chill in the air suggests layers will be essential. Considering the time of year, these temperatures feel fairly typical for early December in the Midwest. For those venturing outside, a warm coat, scarf, and gloves are advisable to combat the biting cold. Activities could include a brisk walk along the beach or a visit to a cozy local caf\u00e9, especially as we head into the holiday season.",
