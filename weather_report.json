    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Evanston, the air carries a distinct chill typical of late November, with the temperature hovering in the low 20s and a brisk, gusty wind whipping in from the west. The scene outside is tinged with gray, indicative of the cloudy skies overhead, setting a muted tone for the day. Waves lap against the shoreline with a gentle rhythm, though the brisk winds are likely to stir them up as the day progresses.\n\nThe forecast promises scattered snow showers until noon, gradually giving way to partly sunny intervals as the afternoon unfolds, with temperatures peaking near the mid-20s before slipping back down slightly. Precipitation chances linger at around 30%, but any accumulation is expected to be minimal. Tonight, expect a clear sky with temperatures dipping to the low teens, reinforcing the stark chill in the air. This cool weather calls for a warm coat, perhaps layered with a sweater, and sturdy footwear if you plan to venture outdoors. The inviting atmosphere of the beach might not be ideal for swimming, and activities such as brisk walks or enjoying hot beverages while taking in the winter landscape seem best suited for the day. As the year draws to a close, this day is simply marked as a regular weekday, but the spirit of the season is undeniably present in the crisp, frosty air.",
