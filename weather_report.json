    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current temperature hovers in the low 30s, delivering a brisk chill that settles into the atmosphere, where clouds blanket the night sky. The calm breeze stirs gently, adding to the perceptible coolness rather than disrupting the serene ambiance. As overnight hours progress, expect the mercury to dip slightly but rebounding to around 32 degrees as morning approaches, with a more pronounced northerly wind that promises to pick up, becoming notably blustery by dawn.  \n\nOn Thanksgiving Day, a mix of overcast and scattered clouds is anticipated, with a high nearing the mid 30s and temperatures gradually falling through the afternoon. While the wave conditions on Lake Michigan will likely present some rolling swells under the gusty winds, no precipitation is expected throughout the day, enhancing the overall crispness of the air. Attire should lean towards layers \u2013 a warm coat, hat, and perhaps gloves will maintain comfort, reflecting the seasonal chill typical for late November in the Midwest. Ideal outdoor pursuits may include brisk walks along the shore or visiting local parks, savoring the peaceful beauty of the landscape in this muted winter light, a few days post-Thanksgiving celebrations.",
