As we move into the afternoon, expect sunny skies with temperatures climbing towards the high 20s, though a slight drop is predicted as evening approaches, settling around the low teens once more. \n\nWave conditions along Lake Michigan are moderate, making for a picturesque scene rather than ideal swimming weather. Fortunately, there\u2019s no precipitation expected, ensuring a dry, pleasant experience outdoors. For those venturing outside, layering up with a warm coat, gloves, and a scarf will provide comfort against the cool air. This weather is typical for December in the Midwest, embracing the season's chill while allowing for charming winter outings. As this is not a holiday, consider enjoying a brisk walk along the lake, savoring the serenity of winter's beauty at this time of year.",
