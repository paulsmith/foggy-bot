    "weather_report": "As evening settles over Evanston, the temperature is hovering in the upper 40s, accompanied by a brisk and blustery breeze sweeping in from the west. The day has been marked by mostly cloudy skies, creating a blanket of gray that softens the atmosphere but maintains the chill felt by those outside. With the wind gusts reaching nearly 30 miles per hour, conditions are certainly not ideal for leisurely strolls along the beach, especially with temperatures expected to drop further tonight, reaching a low in the low 30s. \n\nAs for the coming hours, the forecast suggests that tonight will be mostly cloudy with a gentle wind, perhaps offering a respite from earlier gusts. While no precipitation is expected this evening or into Tuesday, the outlook remains chilly, further emphasized by the impending drop in temperatures. Given the current season, these conditions align with typical Midwestern winters. For those brave enough to venture out, layering is highly recommended: a warm coat, perhaps a hat and gloves, would be wise attire as the wind takes its toll on exposed skin. Ideal activities tonight might include cozy indoor gatherings, enjoying a warm drink, or preparing for the colder days ahead, as winter steadily unfolds.",
