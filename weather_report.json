    "weather_report": "As night falls over Evanston, the air feels brisk and slightly humid, with temperatures settling in the low 40s. The current conditions present a mostly clear sky, providing a calm backdrop to the evening, though the wind is quite blustery, kicking up occasionally from the southeast. Tomorrow's forecast hints at a shift, with mostly cloudy skies and a slight chance of rain later in the day, shouldering its way into the afternoon alongside temperatures that might just touch the mid 50s.\n\nThe beach scene painted by the darkness reflects a serene yet foreboding atmosphere; waves may be somewhat choppy given the gusting winds. If you're venturing out this evening, a light jacket would be wise to stave off the chill. Activities could range from an invigorating walk along the shore to a cozy night in with a warm drink, as the air carries that quintessential fall freshness. Notably, this evening has no immediate holiday or event significance, allowing patrons to revel in the calm before the bustle of the upcoming Thanksgiving season.",
