    "weather_report": "In Evanston today, the weather is characterized by a damp and blustery atmosphere, with light rain currently falling. The temperature rests in the mid-60s, providing a cool yet mildly refreshing feel as the clouds hang low in the sky. Expect the overcast to persist throughout the afternoon, with rain showers likely, and temperatures gradually dipping to the low 60s later on. Winds from the south-southwest will unleash their strength, blowing briskly with occasional gusts, making it feel rather invigorating, albeit a tad uncomfortable for those unprepared.\n\nAs the sun sets this evening, scattered rain showers will continue, giving way to mostly cloudy skies, while temperatures will cool down significantly to the mid-40s. With wave conditions likely stirred up by the gusty winds, the lake may present a choppy surface; thus, those contemplating waterfront activities should approach with caution. Given the continued precipitation and cool air, layered attire including waterproof jackets and perhaps a scarf would be wise this afternoon and into the evening. With today being a regular Sunday, outdoor plans may be best suited for a cozy indoor setting, perhaps enjoying a good book or a warm drink while listening to the raindrops dance against the windows.",
