    "weather_report": "The weather in Evanston, Illinois, at this hour is marked by a chilly 28 degrees, complemented by a blustery wind gusting from the west-northwest. As night blankets the shores of Lake Michigan, the atmosphere is thick with clouds, creating a somber yet serene ambiance. Expect intermittent snow showers to grace the area overnight, with temperatures dipping closer to the low 20s. Tomorrow, a slight reprieve from the snow is anticipated as brief flurries may precede a partly sunny afternoon, albeit with a high near the mid-20s. \n\nThe beach, while beautiful under the shroud of night, might not offer welcoming conditions for leisurely strolls. The waves are likely to be rough, stirred by the gusty winds, adding an edge to the otherwise still scene. In this wintry setting, it would be prudent to layer up\u2014think heavy coats, warm hats, and gloves to stave off the biting chill. As the days march toward December, these temperatures are a stark reminder of the season in this part of the Midwest; such cold is typical for late autumn. Given the conditions, indoor activities or cozy gatherings by the fire would make for a much more pleasant evening than braving the outdoors.",
