    "weather_report": "In Evanston, the current conditions are brisk, with temperatures hovering in the mid-20s and a notable wind creating a biting chill. The sky is partly cloudy, unfolding a scenic albeit chilly landscape by Lake Michigan. As the day advances, we can expect the sun to break through, bringing a slightly warmer high near 25, complemented by a moderate westerly breeze. Tonight, clear skies will take over, with temperatures dropping into the low teens and wind chills potentially plummeting to around -2, inviting a need for warm attire.\n\nThe general appearance today is less than inviting for outdoor activities, with the cold and gusty winds making it feel much colder than it is. Wave conditions on the lake, influenced by the howling winds, may display notable turbulence, cautioning any adventurous spirits against venturing onto the water. With little prospect for precipitation, the overall outlook remains dry. It is advisable to bundle up warmly, opting for layers and perhaps a sturdy coat if heading outside. Given that this is the winter season in the Midwest, the current mid-20s temperature is typical, albeit on the colder end of the spectrum. As the day draws to a close, indoor plans like visiting local cafes or enjoying a warm meal might be the most appealing activities to consult prior to braving the chill.",
