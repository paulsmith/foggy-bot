    "weather_report": "In Evanston, Illinois, the current weather presents a chilly and damp scene, with temperatures lingering in the low 30s and a light snow falling, adding a delicate layer of white to the already muted landscape. The gusty winds, coming from the north at nearly 25 miles per hour, create a brisk atmosphere, causing the air to feel colder than it actually is. As the day progresses, snow will continue to dominate, with a high anticipated near mid 30s. The forecast predicts consistent snowfall throughout the day, with a 100% chance of accumulation potentially reaching around one inch by evening. \n\nThe beach panorama, normally inviting, takes on a somber and quiet ambiance under gray skies and falling snowflakes, not the best for a leisurely stroll along the shore. Wave activity is likely subdued given the weather, so it's wise to steer clear of the waterfront for safety. For those heading outdoors, bundling up is essential; a heavy coat, gloves, and a warm hat will make a crucial difference. Even as winter deepens, today's temperatures are typical for this time of year in the region, though the biting wind adds a layer of discomfort. Consider staying cozy indoors by reading a good book or indulging in a warm beverage\u2014activities perfectly suited for a snowy winter day.",
