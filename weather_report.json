    "weather_report": "Evanston is currently enveloped in a chilly drizzle, with temperatures in the mid 30s, creating a damp atmosphere that might leave one feeling rather raw outdoors. The southeast winds are brisk, lending a blustery edge to the prevailing conditions. As night approaches, rain is expected to intensify before tapering off into widespread drizzle and fog. The temperatures will rise slightly overnight, settling into the upper 30s, but it will remain predominantly cloudy, keeping any chance of star-gazing at bay.\n\nTomorrow, the skies are set to remain overcast, with lingering drizzle and fog likely until the afternoon. Daytime highs will reach into the low 40s, which is typical for this time of year in the Midwest. Wave conditions on Lake Michigan may be stirred up due to the persistent winds, providing a choppy surface rather than the usual tranquil view. It would be wise for those venturing outdoors to dress warmly, opting for waterproof outer layers to combat the chill and potential for rain. Activities such as cozying up with a hot drink or enjoying the company of friends indoors could be more fulfilling given the weather. No major holidays mark this evening, but the tranquility of a rainy night might just lend itself to a reflective mood.",
