    "weather_report": "As twilight settles over Evanston, the current weather paints a rather cool and damp picture, with temperatures hovering in the low 50s. The air carries a notable humidity, making it feel slightly chillier than the thermometer suggests, while the wind whistles through the night, brisk and blustery at around 40 miles per hour. The skies are cloaked in clouds, casting a muted ambiance over the beachside scene as the day gives way to night.\n\nLooking ahead to Veterans Day, tomorrow promises a transition to mostly sunny skies, with a high that will flirt with the mid-50s before tapering off into the low 40s by afternoon. The winds will remain spirited, blowing from the west-northwest around 15 to 20 miles per hour, with occasional gusts that could rattle the trees. For those planning outdoor activities, it is advisable to dress in layers, with a light jacket to fend off the evening chill, especially as the beach might still hold the bite of lingering winds. In this season of late fall, the current temperatures are typical for the region, reminding us that winter is fast approaching. Given these conditions, a stroll along the shoreline could be refreshing, perhaps punctuated by a warm beverage in hand, while the more adventurous might find the winds ideal for kite flying or simply enjoying the invigorating air by the lakeside.",
