    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston reveal a chilly scene by Lake Michigan, where the air is brisk and slightly moody with temperatures hovering in the mid-20s, complemented by a stillness in the atmosphere. The sky is mostly cloudy, allowing for occasional glimpses of sunlight, though a light haze blankets the view. As the day progresses, there's a slight chance for snow showers this afternoon before 5 PM, with temperatures expected to peak around the upper 20s. Tonight, the forecast calls for a cool evening settling into the upper teens, with a continued northwest breeze providing a sharp bite to the air.\n\nThe waves along the shore are likely mild, given the wind is relatively calm, promoting a serene, reflective atmosphere rather than tumultuous seas. Despite the brisk chill, which would likely feel uncomfortable without layers, suitable attire would include a warm coat, perhaps a knitted scarf, and sturdy boots, ideal for a walk along the beach. This time of year, temperatures are characteristic of a Chicago winter, signaling that residents should ready themselves for the colder months ahead. While indoor activities may take precedence, a brief walk along the shoreline could offer a refreshing escape, so long as one is mindful of the potential flurries later in the day.",
