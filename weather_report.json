    "weather_report": "On this chilly January night in Evanston, the current conditions are marked by a biting cold, with the temperature hovering in the low 20s. The air is clear, although gusty winds from the northwest are adding an extra bite, creating wind chill values that feel like the low single digits. As the night progresses, expect temperatures to drop further, settling around 10 degrees with wind chill plunging to as low as -4. While the sky remains mostly clear tonight, it\u2019s essential to be mindful of the robust winds that may feel relentless. \n\nTomorrow brings a touch of sunshine, but with the high reaching only the low 20s, the day is bound to feel brisk. Anticipate wind chill values again dipping as low as -5 due to a continued blustery atmosphere. The waves at Lake Michigan may exhibit a gentle roll, particularly under the influence of those gusty winds, but no precipitation is expected. Given the winter season, these temperatures are quite typical for Evanston, where bundled layers are advisable. Dress warmly with insulated outerwear, hats, and gloves if heading outside, and perhaps indulge in some brisk walks along the beach while appreciating the serene clarity of the landscape.",
