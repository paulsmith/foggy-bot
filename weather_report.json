    "weather_report": "This morning in Evanston, conditions remain on the chilly side with a temperature settling in the low 40s, accompanied by a thick blanket of fog that casts a cold, damp veil over the beach and harbor area. The southerly breeze has kicked up to a mild level, adding a biting chill that may not be pleasant for long stretches outdoors. As the day progresses, expect areas of fog and patchy drizzle to persist, yielding a cloudy atmosphere with a high topping out near the mid 40s. The forecast suggests a modest chance of precipitation, with drizzle remaining a possibility throughout the day.\n\nWith temperatures hovering around the seasonal norms for mid-December in the Midwest, this damp chill may feel a bit uninviting, particularly for outdoor activities. Wave conditions in the lake could be moderate given the winds, inviting cautious exploration for those keen on braving the shore. Recommended attire includes a warm coat, perhaps layered with a scarf and gloves, to shield against the cool, moist air. Despite the dreary weather, options like visiting local caf\u00e9s or museums, or taking a brisk walk along the shore edge, may provide some reprieve. Today is the 15th of December, a time often reserved for holiday preparations, adding a sense of warmth amidst the cool skies.",
