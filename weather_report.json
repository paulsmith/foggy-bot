    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston paint a chilly picture, with temperatures hovering in the low teens, keeping it crisp and cool as night envelops the city. The eerie stillness of the beach contrasts sharply with the promise of snow showers anticipated later tonight before the skies clear, plunging temperatures down to around 5 degrees. Wind chill values are set to take a significant dip, possibly sinking as low as -13, due to a steady shift of gusty northwesterly winds reaching 15 to 20 mph, enticing a bleak yet serene atmosphere along the lakeshore.\n\nTomorrow, expect mostly sunny skies with temperatures barely scraping the mid-teens. However, wind chill will likely keep actual feelings of warmth at bay, so dress warmly if venturing outside. With the robust northern winds and low temperatures typical for a December evening in this region, this is a time for bundled coats, hats, and gloves if tackling outdoor activities. The Lake Michigan waves will remain calm in this cold, but finding an inviting moment outdoors might prove challenging unless one is prepared with the right winter apparel. Enjoying a quiet walk along the shoreline or appreciating the beauty of winter\u2019s grasp might just be the tranquil antidote to the upcoming season\u2019s hustle and bustle.",
