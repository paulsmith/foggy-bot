    "weather_report": "Current conditions in Evanston paint a vivid winter scene, with temperatures settling in the low 40s and a fierce wind sweeping in from the west. The air feels decidedly crisp, reminiscent of a chilly evening, while the sky remains shrouded in clouds, casting a muted light over the landscape. With wind speeds that are quite blustery, the atmosphere here is animated, further heightened by the humidity that adds an edge to the cold. Tonight, expect mostly cloudy skies and a steady drop in temperature, nearing the mid-30s, with gusts that may reach up to 25mph.\n\nAs you look towards Lake Michigan, the waves may not be overly aggressive given the conditions, but they are likely roused by the strong winds. There is no immediate precipitation in sight, allowing for a clearer evening, albeit a brisk one. It\u2019s advisable to bundle up with layers\u2014perhaps a warm coat, scarf, and sturdy footwear, as gusty conditions can chill you quickly. Given that we are well into the winter season and experiencing typical weather for this time of year in the Midwest, outdoor activities may be limited. However, a refreshing walk along the beach, taking in the robust sights and sounds of winter, could be invigorating; just keep an eye on the evening chill.",
