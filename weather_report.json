    "weather_report": "Current temperatures in Evanston hover in the low 30s, which feels sharp and brisk as winds howl from the northwest at a dizzying speed. The air carries a damp chill that settles in, making outdoor ventures feel notably cool and somewhat uncomfortable. As evening approaches, the sky presents a thick blanket of clouds, promising a night of partial obscurity with a low dipping down to the mid 20s, accompanied by gentle shifts in wind.\n\nLooking ahead to Thursday, residents might want to keep an eye on the skies, as there\u2019s a chance of light snow after 1 PM. The forecast indicates mostly cloudy conditions with a high creeping toward the mid 30s, under the flow of a gentle breeze from the south-southeast. Wave activity at Lake Michigan could be moderate, which might call for caution for those near the water's edge. While snow accumulation is expected to be minimal, it could create a picturesque winter scene. As preparations begin for the upcoming holidays, make sure to bundle up if you\u2019re stepping out, with recommended attire including warm layers, hats, and gloves to maintain comfort against the biting cold. Given the seasonal chill, this weather is decidedly typical for December in the Midwest, as the region settles in for winter\u2019s embrace.",
