    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Evanston, temperatures hover in the low 20s, presenting a bitter chill that makes the air feel brisk yet invigorating. The substantial wind roaring in from the northwest adds to the formidable sensation, making it an uninviting scene for outdoor activities at this hour. Expect this evening to give way to a partly cloudy sky, with temperatures slowly rising towards the upper teens overnight.\n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, the morning promises to greet us with mostly sunny skies and temperatures reaching near the upper 20s. While a light breeze adds a touch of crispness to the air, conditions should feel considerably more pleasant as the day unfolds. As the sun shines, any lingering chill will likely give way to a more comfortable atmosphere, making the beach and lakeside parks appealing spots for brisk strolls. With no precipitation expected and the cloud cover easing, Evanston can anticipate a bright and refreshing day. Given the season, these temperatures align with the typical winter expectations, though wind gusts may amplify the chill. \n\nFor those venturing outside, warm attire is essential, including hats, gloves, and cozy layers to fend off the cold. Whether it\u2019s grabbing a warm drink or simply basking in the breezy sunshine, it promises to be a day for appreciating the winter landscape.",
