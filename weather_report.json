    "weather_report": "As dusk falls over Evanston, the current conditions reveal a chilly evening with temperatures hovering in the mid 30s and a persistent cloud cover casting a gray hue over the surroundings. The brisk wind is blustery, adding a bite to the air that may compel one to seek warmth indoors. Tonight, the forecast predicts light snow likely to begin after midnight, with a low settling around the low 30s. A gentle breeze from the west northwest will continue, potentially bringing flurries that could dust the ground but with little accumulation expected.\n\nMoving into Wednesday, residents can anticipate a chance of morning snow giving way to partly sunny skies as temperatures struggle to break into the mid 30s before cooling further in the afternoon. With a northwest wind that may bring gusts, it\u2019s advisable to dress warmly\u2014layers, hats, and gloves will be key in providing comfort against the chill. Although typical temperatures for this time of year should align with the forecast, the weather delivers a stark reminder of winter\u2019s grip. Despite the cold, opportunities for brisk walks along the lake are inviting, particularly in the early light, while the chance of fresh snow might entice some to enjoy the wintry landscape. However, for those looking to remain cozy, staying indoors with a warm beverage may be preferable as the holiday season is fast approaching.",
