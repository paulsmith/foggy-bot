    "weather_report": "As the sun begins to sink below the horizon in Evanston, the current conditions paint a chilly picture. With temperatures hovering in the low 30s and a brisk north-northwest wind creating a blustery atmosphere, it feels distinctly cold as winter's grip tightens. Overcast skies lend a muted feel to the day, casting a dim light on the beach that lies at the edge of Lake Michigan. Tonight, expect scattered snow showers before 2 a.m., with a low dipping to around 24, and a chance of light accumulation on the ground.\n\nLooking to tomorrow, the weather holds a promise of partly sunny skies with a high near 29, although it remains uninviting for outdoor activities. The cold air coupled with a gentle breeze may leave one feeling more inclined to stay indoors. The presence of snow showers adds a touch of the winter wonderland, yet the rawness of the cold could deter leisurely outings. Given the overall chill and potential for precipitation, warm layers, hats, and gloves are recommended for anyone braving the elements. While the day itself does not coincide with any major holidays, Valentine's Day approaches swiftly, bringing thoughts of warmth and affection even as temperatures remain firmly on the winter side of the spectrum.",
