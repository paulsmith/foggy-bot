    "weather_report": "Currently in Evanston, temperatures hover in the mid-30s, presenting a crisp and cool atmosphere noted by a blustery northwest wind. The skies are partly cloudy, casting a muted light over Lake Michigan, creating an overall somewhat gloomy yet tranquil scene. Residents can expect mostly cloudy conditions for the day, with temperatures forecasted to flirt around the freezing mark, dipping slightly as the afternoon progresses. Winds will shift to a gentler pace later in the day, ranging from light to breezy, allowing for a more comfortable feel as evening approaches.\n\nWave conditions along the shore will likely be moderate, with the chilly temperatures and recent winds creating a somewhat lively atmosphere on the water. Thankfully, precipitation isn\u2019t on the agenda today, meaning that outdoor plans shouldn\u2019t be washed away. To warmly embrace the chilly climate, it would be prudent to dress in layers, opting for warm outerwear and accessories like hats and gloves, particularly if venturing outdoors or along the beach. This time of year typically sees such wintry temperatures in the Midwest, which aligns with seasonal expectations. Given the conditions, a stroll along the shoreline or a winter bike ride could be quite pleasant as long as one is suitably dressed for the elements, allowing you to appreciate the quiet beauty of a winter's day by Lake Michigan.",
